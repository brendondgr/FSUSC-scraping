*   **Units:** 3
*   **Schedule/Location:** M W F 12:00-12:50, 152 DSL
*   **Instructor:** Chen Huang
*   **Description:** The course is designed for students who are interested in atomistic simulations of molecules and materials. Two popular methods will be introduced: density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics. DFT has become the workhorse in industry and academia for calculating various properties of materials and molecules, such as electronic properties, crystal structures, and chemical reaction energies. We will learn both the theoretical and numerical aspects of DFT. Molecular dynamics are invaluable for understanding the dynamical processes of materials at the atomic scale. We will introduce the theories underlying molecular dynamics simulations and learn how to calculate various properties of materials using molecular dynamics. Popular software in these two fields will be introduced.

These behaviors are governed by fuel properties, atmospheric conditions, topography, and more. This course introduces physics-based and data-driven models in fire science, and investigates the sensitivity and uncertainty of these models. We will discuss computational tools including cellular automata, level set methods, and data-driven methods for discovering equations from measured data. Finally, we will explore techniques for analyzing both simulated and measured fire data.

**Course Details**
*   **Category:** Undergraduate Courses
*   **Code:** ISC 4933
*   **Title:** Understanding Covid
*   **Offered:** Fall 2022
*   **Schedule & Location:** MWF 10:40-11:30, 499 DSL
*   **Description:** In this course, students will explore the different elements that determine the outcome of infectious disease in humans, using COVID-19 as a case study. Starting with a very basic model that includes susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, students will gradually incorporate factors that may affect the outcome of an outbreak, such as masking/quarantining, gain and loss of natural and vaccine-based immunity, and changing virulence/strains. After summarizing data already collected during the recent pandemic, students will inform the model to determine the conditions under which different outcomes may occur. Students will summarize their results graphically and present their findings. No prerequisites or programming experience required. The course is designed to be accessible to all students, regardless of background or major.
