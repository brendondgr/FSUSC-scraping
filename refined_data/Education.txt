**Undergraduate Programs**
*   **Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computational Science:**
    *   **Description:** An innovative degree program where students learn to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.
    *   **Target Audience:** Well-suited for students who like working on computers and are interested in mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.), or engineering. It is of special interest to students interested in multiple of these areas.
    *   **Key Distinction:** Computational science is different from computer science. Computer science is about the science of computers, whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.
*   **Minor in Computational Science:**
    *   **Description:** Offers a substantive programming and algorithmic knowledge base to non-Computational Science students.
    *   **Benefit:** Students develop critical computing and modeling skills that are marketable and attractive to potential employers.
    *   **Requirements:** At least 14 hours of coursework. Students must earn a C- or above in each course for it to be accepted for minor credit.
