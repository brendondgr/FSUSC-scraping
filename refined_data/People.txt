**Testimonials**

*   "Thank you for teaching me R! Since completing my Masters a few years ago Iâ€™ve been working in business analytics. The last year and a half with a movie theater chain mining their customer databases and performing website experiments to help improve the business. I got that job 100% because of a report I put together using R." - **GF**
