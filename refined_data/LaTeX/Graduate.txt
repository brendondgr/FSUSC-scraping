\section{Degree Programs Overview}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/ms}

The educational mission of the Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) is to provide innovative, interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate training programs in computational science and its applications. The graduate and undergraduate degree programs in the DSC are designed to provide students with a broad training in the design, implementation, and use of algorithms for solving science and engineering problems on computers.

\subsection*{The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree}
The Department of Scientific Computing offers an innovative \textbf{Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree program in Computational Science}.

This degree program should be of interest to and is well suited for those who like working on computers and who ordinarily would also be interested in any of the mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), or any of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, geological sciences, ...), or any engineering discipline. It should be of special interest to students interested in two or more of these areas. Students majoring in Computational Science will learn how to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.

Please note that \textit{computational science} is \textit{different} from \textit{computer science}. At the risk of oversimplifying things, one can say that computer science is about the science of computers whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.

\subsection*{The Minor degree}
The Minor in Computational Science offers a substantive programming and algorithmic knowledge base to non-Computational Science students. Students who minor in the discipline will develop critical computing and modeling skills that are marketable and attractive to potential employers.

The minor requires at least 14 hours of coursework, and students must make a C- or above in each class for the course to be accepted for minor credit.

\subsection*{The Master of Science (M.S.) degrees}
\begin{itemize}
    \item M.S. in Computational Science
    \item M.S. in Data Science
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree consists of several majors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ph.D. in Computational Science
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Atmospheric Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Biochemistry}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Biological Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Geological Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Materials Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Physics}
\end{itemize}
Students who choose the first major specialize in the more mathematical or computer science aspects of computational science.

Because computational science lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, applied science, engineering, and computer science, the DSC has the unique ability to offer coursework and research opportunities at all levels in topic areas that cut across disciplines. The focus of the research and training activities of the DSC is on the invention, analysis, and implementation of computational algorithms that transcend disciplines and the application of such algorithms to various applications, including, among others, astrophysics, bioinformatics, climate and weather modeling, computational fluid mechanics, computational geometry, computer game design, evolutionary biology, data mining, GPU computing, high-energy density physics, high-performance computing, hydrology, machine learning, material science, medical imaging, morphometrics, nano-materials, numerical analysis, partial differential equations, phylogenetics, polymers, population genetics, scientific visualization, subsurface environmental modeling, superconductivity, systems biology, and uncertainty quantification.

Unlike the faculty of a typical department whose training and research interests lie solely within a single discipline, the faculty of the DSC includes members trained in a variety of disciplines - biology, aeronautical engineering, chemical engineering, geological sciences, electrical engineering, material sciences, mathematics, nuclear engineering, and physics. In addition, the DSC has several affiliated faculty members in other departments at FSU and at other universities, companies, and laboratories that further enhance the educational and research experiences of students in the DSC's degree programs.

In addition to offering degree programs, the DSC contributes to FSU's educational mission by offering courses of interest to students in other departments, by offering tutorials and short courses, and by managing high-performance computational resources available to the campus community.

\section{Undergraduate Programs}

\subsection{Undergraduate Overview}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/undergraduate/overview}

The Department of Scientific Computing offers an innovative \textbf{B.S. degree program in Computational Science}.

This degree program should be of interest to and is well suited for those who like working on computers and who ordinarily would also be interested in any of the mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), or any of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, geological sciences, ...), or any engineering discipline. It should be of special interest to students interested in two or more of these areas. Students majoring in Computational Science will learn how to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.

The \textbf{Department of Scientific Computing} is the focal point of computational science activities at FSU. Computational science involves the invention, implementation, testing, and application of algorithms and software used to solve large-scale scientific and engineering problems. The Department provides a venue for innovative research and education in computational science. Our faculty come from a wide variety of traditional mathematical, scientific, and engineering disciplines who are primarily interested in developing knowledge and tools for computational science and applying those tools to the solution of problems in a variety of applications.

Please note that computational science is different from computer science. At the risk of oversimplifying things, one can say that computer science is about the science of computers whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.

The undergraduate \textbf{Minor} and \textbf{B.S.} degree programs in Computational Science, along with the already established \textbf{Master's} and \textbf{Ph.D.} programs, trains students in computational science by providing them with a mix of theory and practice, including substantial hands-on experience in the deployment and use of algorithms for solving scientific and engineering problems.

Questions should be sent to \texttt{<email protected>}. Anyone in the neighborhood interested in knowing more about the undergraduate degree program is welcome to stop by the Department offices located on the 4th floor of the Dirac Science Library.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computational Science}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/phd}

Many of the important problems facing society today can only be solved by teams of individuals from a variety of disciplines. An individual trained in an interdisciplinary environment is an essential member of such a team because he/she can successfully interact with team members and gain an overall understanding of the problem.

However, most doctoral programs in this country have a very narrow focus and consequently, students rarely have the opportunity to understand research themes in other disciplines or even to explore the relevance of their own research to other fields. Since the Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, applied science, computer science and engineering, it has the unique opportunity to train students in areas which cut across disciplines.

\subsubsection*{Ph.D Program Tracks}
The goal of the Ph.D. program in Computational Science is to train graduate students to have extensive knowledge in computational science and to allow the student to acquire expertise in one or more areas of the sciences, mathematics, or engineering. Students may choose to follow the major track in computational science which allows them to specialize in aspects of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item computational mathematics
    \item computer science
\end{itemize}
relevant to computational science or choose to complete one of the following specialized tracks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ph.D. in Computational Science with a Specialization in \textbf{Atmospheric Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Biochemistry}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Biological Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Geological Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Materials Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Physics}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Coursework \& credits}
Since computational science is an interdisciplinary program, students' programs of study can be quite varied. Consequently, we have built in a lot of flexibility into the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Computational Science. The commonality in the coursework is that each student must take the same four computational science courses (Group A courses), which cut across disciplines, as well as a minimum of 9 credit hours in other computational science courses (Group B courses) plus 9 additional credit hours selected from existing departmental courses in computer science, engineering, mathematics or an applied science (Group C courses). Each student must also take six seminar hours (details are listed in the Graduate Handbook, section 5.2.2).

There are a total of 29 credit hours of coursework that are specified plus a minimum of 24 credits of dissertation hours. A specialization is obtained by completing a minimum of 9 credit hours from courses in the discipline approved by the student's supervisory committee.

The \textbf{required core courses (Group A)} consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to Scientific Programming (3 credits)
    \item Applied Computational Science I (4 credits)
    \item Applied Computational Science II (4 credits)
    \item Parallel Programming, Algorithms and Architectures (3 credits)
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{elective core courses (Group B)} consist of courses such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo/Markov Chain Simulations
    \item Survey of Numerical PDEs
    \item Computational Space Physics
    \item Programming Skills for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
    \item Computational Evolutionary Biology
    \item Introduction to Bioinformatics
    \item Computational Finite Element Methods
    \item Numerical Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations
    \item Numerical Methods for Earth and Environmental Sciences
    \item Molecular Dynamics
    \item Numerical Linear Algebra
    \item Data mining
    \item Visualization
    \item Verification and Validation in Computational Science
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} Student should select a minimum of three courses from Group B, which are approved by his/her supervisory committee.

\subsubsection*{Application and Information}
Students applying to this program should have earned a bachelor's or master's degree in an applied science, mathematics, computer science or engineering and possess a keen interest in computational science. The DSC expect that graduates of this program will be prepared to seek employment in academic, industrial, or laboratory settings.

It is an interdisciplinary field of study whose primary goal is an improvement in our basic understanding of fluid flows that occur naturally, including such topics as climate and paleoclimate, biogeochemical processes, hydrology and Karst dynamics, air-sea interaction, wild fire dynamics, double diffusive processes, and hurricane dynamics with strong links to the Applied Mathematics Program. The approach to this understanding is through quantitative analysis of observational records and theoretical, mathematical, numerical, and experimenting modeling. A geophysical fluid dynamicist must have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of classical physics, knowledge of the techniques of applied mathematics, and an interest in the natural sciences.

\paragraph{FACILITIES} These facilities include a large modern laboratory for hydrodynamics experiments, a colloquium room and reading room, a photographic and illustrations laboratory, a large modern machine shop, a precision instrument-makers laboratory, and faculty and student offices. Institute facilities also include several precision rotating turntables, a six-meter water channel, convection tanks, temperature controlling systems, general and digital photographic systems, multi-channel data acquisition systems, laser facilities, various machine tools, and other electronic equipment. The institute houses a facility for measuring ocean turbulence as well.
