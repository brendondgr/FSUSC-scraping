The Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) plays a major role in the support of FSU's cyberinfrastructure by providing facilities and technical expertise in the support of scientific computing. The DSC manages a dedicated computing facility located on the main FSU campus in Dirac Science Library. The DSC facility provides a highly flexible computing environment designed to support specialized and experimental hardware and software systems.

\subsection{DSC Computing Facility}
The DSC facility supports an assortment of computer architectures, interconnects, and operating systems. Systems hosted in the DSC facility are owned by DSC and are dedicated to a wide range of research problems including; machine learning, neuroscience, molecular biophysics, evolutionary biology, network modeling, and Monte-Carlo algorithm development. The DSC facility is equipped with two 40-ton HVAC cooling units, 1000 ft$^2$ of raised floor, an extensive power distribution system, UPS battery backup systems, and a 550 KVA diesel-powered backup generator, which provides backup power to all of the hardware and HVACs in this server room. The DSC network is built on a 10 Gbps backbone, providing connectivity to a switching infrastructure and to key servers and storage. The DSC network connects via 100 Gbps to the FSU campus backbone, which in turn connects to the Florida/National LamdaRail.

The DSC supports a general access laboratory for scientific visualization and computational intelligence. The laboratory is located in the center of the main FSU campus on the fourth floor of the Dirac Science Library (DSL). The Visualization Laboratory hosts several high-end visualization workstations each equipped with GPU video cards that are compatible with the CUDA SDK. All workstations have access to a multi-terabyte shared high-performance storage.

\par The DSC's visualization resources also include a high-resolution laser projection system to support multidisciplinary scientific visualization. The system is located in our main seminar room adjacent to the Visualization Lab. A cutting edge 4K Enhancement Technology rear-mounted projector illuminates an 18' x 8' screen. The system supports numerous input devices via a simple to use touch panel screen.

\section{General DSC Infrastructure}

The DSC provides office space to DSC faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and other DSC associated support personnel. Designated visitor offices are also available. All offices are equipped with a desktop computer and network connections; wireless is available throughout campus. The department of Scientific Computing supports a cutting edge classroom facility on the campus of FSU to support scientific programming curriculum. The classroom was funded in part by a Student Technology fee award for instructional technology enhancements. The room is equipped with 19 Intel-based workstations running LINUX or Windows and is used primarily for classes taught by DSC faculty. In addition to the computer classroom, a large seminar room is located on the fourth floor with a capacity for 80 people and is equipped with a 4K Enhanced rear-mounted laser projection system. Also, two conference rooms equipped with large high-definition displays can facilitate smaller groups.

\section{DSC Classroom}

The Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) takes pride in its cutting-edge classroom facility designed to cater to modern computational and scientific needs. Situated within the FSU campus, the classroom has been recently updated to include the latest technology, thereby providing a conducive environment for effective teaching and learning.

\par The classroom is equipped with 20 new systems, each powered by an Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Core\texttrademark~i9-10940X processor, boasting 3.30GHz speed and 14 cores. These machines are fitted with a robust 64GB of RAM, ensuring rapid data processing and multitasking capabilities. The GPU in these systems is the NVIDIA RTX A5000, designed to handle intense graphics and data-intensive tasks, making them ideal for research in machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

\par The DSC Classroom is a testament to FSU's commitment to providing state-of-the-art facilities for research and education in scientific computing. With this advanced setup, students and faculty have the resources they need for in-depth exploration and innovative problem-solving in various domains.
