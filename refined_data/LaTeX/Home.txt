We are excited to offer a new 30-credit MS degree in Interdisciplinary Data Science (IDS) with a major in Scientific Computing beginning in Fall 2021!

\section{The Uniqueness of the Department of Scientific Computing at FSU}
\textit{Source: \url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/}}

Our department offers innovative undergraduate and graduate programs in computational science that impart a synergy among multi-disciplines, thus providing extensive, interdisciplinary hands-on training. We are a self-contained department, unusual among universities, whose faculty members consist of biologists, computer scientists, engineers, geneticists, geophysicists, material scientists, hydrologists, mathematicians, and physicists. Such a varied representation among disciplines opens doors for an even broader spectrum of research interests to be represented in the future.

\section{Facilities}
\textit{Source: \url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/}}

We maintain a large \textit{computing infrastructure} in support of \textit{research} and \textit{education}. Our computing resources include \textit{large super-computers}, \textit{specialized high-performance computational servers}, a laboratory for \textit{computational intelligence} and \textit{scientific visualization}, a bio-informatics server, a \textit{morphometrics lab}, and much more. We also house a state of the art computer classroom as well as a large multi-purpose seminar room with an 8-foot by 16-foot rear laser projection screen.
