\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/hardware}

The Department of Scientific Computing maintains computing hardware in a robust machine room on the fourth floor of Dirac Science Library. Most the hardware in this machine room is owned by DSC and non-DSC research groups and is dedicated to a wide range of research problems including; molecular biophysics, evolutionary biology, network modeling, and Monte-Carlo algorithm development. DSC faculty and students can access the idle cycles on the owner based machines by using a system called \texttt{condor}. The \texttt{condor system} is configured to match single process non-interactive batch submissions to any idle CPUs hosted in the DSC machine room or in DSC desktop machines. Some general access machines are made available to DSC faculty and students to compile software and to run interactive jobs, e.g., MatLab. Also, the DSC manages and supports a general access visualization lab and FSU's shared HPC facility. To learn more about the hardware resources hosted or managed by DSC, click on one of the links below.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Access}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access}

The Department of Scientific Computing manages and supports a number of general access facilities for DSC faculty and students as well the University computing in general. Click on any of the links below to learn more about these resources.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interactive
    \item Visualization
    \item High Performance Computing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{High Performance Computing (RCC)}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/hpc}

\paragraph{The Research Computing Center (RCC)} - formerly known as the FSU shared-HPC facility - enables multidisciplinary computing for the FSU research community. To learn more about this facility please see the RCC web site.
\begin{itemize}
    \item RCC Homepage
    \item High-performance Computing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interactive}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/interactive}

DSC students, faculty, and students taking Computational Science courses can interactively access the computers located in DSL 152 and the hallway via \texttt{ssh}. This allows you to request interactive resources and it will randomly instantiate a session on a workstation. What follows is a quick start for the DSC environment.

\paragraph{How to Run an Interactive Job}
Open an X11 terminal and type:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{qlogin}
    \item OR
    \item \texttt{hallway} (to access hallway nodes only)
    \item \texttt{classroom} (to access classroom nodes only)
\end{itemize}

After authenticating, type the name of the program you want to run, e.g., \texttt{matlab}.

If \texttt{qlogin} is not available on your machine, you must run the above commands from a DSC desktop. SSH to a DSC desktop or hallway machine:
\texttt{ssh -X hallway-a.sc.fsu.edu}

Then follow the above instructions.

\paragraph{Access Policy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 job per user
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Availability}
Classroom queues are available with the exception of Mon - Fri 7:45 AM till 6:00 PM.
Hallway queues are available 24/7.
To guarantee which queue you land in please use either \texttt{qlogin -q classroon} or \texttt{qlogin -q hallway}.

\textbf{NOTE:} All remote classroom sessions will be terminated at 7:45 AM M-F. The purpose of the classroom and hallway machines is primarily for students to do their assignments - not as a production engine. Use FSU's HPC system (\url{http://rcc.fsu.edu}) for production batch schedule jobs.

\subsubsection{Visualization}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/visualization}

It is said that "A picture is worth a thousand words". How true. The ultimate goal of scientific visualization is to provide scientists with tools that permit them to analyze their data, extract information/features, correlate that information, and display their data in a meaningful way. More importantly, visualization encourages the scientists to ask questions. The more interactive an application, the more questions a scientist can pose. Application areas with large scale datasets (steady or time-dependent) include oceanography, study of hurricanes, data assimilation techniques, phylogenetic tree evolution, geophysics, fluid dynamics, and more.

The visualization laboratory is a DSC facility available for the use of researchers across the entire Florida State University Campus. Use is divided into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualization Research
    \item Visualization Education
    \item Application of Visualization
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Applications}
The laboratory is open to all researchers of Florida State University who have a need to visualize and analyze their simulation or other data. Be sure to check out the tutorial section of this web site. This access can take several forms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Work within the visualization lab}, making use of dual large screens for maximum flexibility during the generation and rendering of large scale imagery and the generation of sophisticated animations. User data resides on our local 12 TByte storage facility.
    \item \textbf{Remote access to the visualization laboratory from desktop computers or workstations}. Typically this involves remote SSH connections and X-Window tunneling to run applications on the visualization machines from another location--this does not fully support hardware based graphics. During the coming months the Vis Lab will be testing innovative new software from HP, which allows users to execute any software that runs locally from a remote desktop Linux or windows machine in full graphics mode. As in the first case, data would be stored on our local file system for maximum efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Education}
Perhaps most importantly, visualization is an integral component of the workflow adopted by researchers around the world. Visualization is necessary to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item construct computational grids that discretize the physical domain,
    \item check data for accuracy, correctness
    \item analyze simulation data
    \item extract features from simulation data
    \item ask questions of the data
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Research}
Scientists are encourage to use the laboratory for advanced research in the area of scientific visualization. Areas of interest include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real time rendering using graphics hardware
    \item Remote rendering
    \item Collaborative visualization
    \item Pattern recognition
    \item Feature extraction
    \item Information visualization
    \item Visual realism
    \item Visualization of uncertainty
    \item Visualization of stochastic multi-dimensional processes
    \item Visualization of higher dimensional data (four and above)
    \item and more ...
    \item Computer Vision
\end{itemize}
