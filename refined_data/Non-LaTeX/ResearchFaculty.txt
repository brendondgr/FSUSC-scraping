Name: Beerli, Peter
Title: Professor & Chair, Department of Scientific Computing

Research Interests:
- Biological Sciences
- Population Genetics
- Phylogenetics
- Bayesian inference
- Model selection
Description: I started out my science career as a practical evolutionary biologist working with frogs on islands in the mediterranean sea. There was no good analysis software for my data available at that time. Therefore, in 1994, I started a career as a computational biologist developing software (MIGRATE: https://popgen.sc.fsu.edu) for other biologists to analyze large-scale DNA datasets and compare different evolutionary hypotheses. My interests have centered on the coalescent and how we can use that to infer parameters of population genetic models and also compare them statistically.

Title: Assistant Professor

Research Interests:
- Data Assimilation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Numerical Weather Prediction
- Atmospheric Dynamics
Description: My research encompasses theoretical, computational and applied aspects of data assimilation â€” the science of optimally combining numerical models and observations of physical systems. In the past, I have utilized data assimilation algorithms to improve the representation of atmospheric convection through the incorporation of ground-based remote sensors. More recently, my focus has shifted to the development of new data assimilation methods which capitalize on the ongoing AI revolution. Beyond data assimilation, my interests also extend to numerical weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, and various topics within the data sciences.

Name: Erlebacher, Gordon
Title: Professor, Department of Scientific Computing; Program Director, Interdisciplinary Data Science
Email: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
Research Interests:
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence
Description: I have been engaged in the development of artificial intelligence since 2014, beginning with the advent of word2vec. Over the years, my research has evolved alongside the field, encompassing work on autoencoders, pruning techniques, graph neural networks, and topic modeling, eventually leading to modern transformer-based architectures. More recently, my focus has shifted toward the application of large language models (LLMs) in education, where I am developing tools to enhance classroom engagement and learning outcomes using frontier AI capabilities. I am also exploring the integration of agentic systems to streamline operations within the Department of Scientific Computing, with the dual goals of reducing administrative workload and improving visibility to prospective students.
