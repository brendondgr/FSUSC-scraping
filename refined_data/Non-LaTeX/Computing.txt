**Overview:**
The Department of Scientific Computing maintains a large and dynamic computing infrastructure in support of research and education. Computing resources include the FSU RCC/HPC, a number of clusters and computational servers, a laboratory for scientific visualization, a bioinformatics server, and more. While many of the department's computing resources are dedicated to specific research areas, an increasing number of machines are being made available to the University research community in general through the use of high throughput management tools and job schedulers.

**Main Sections:**
*   Getting Started
*   Hardware
*   Remote Access
*   Software
*   General Access

### Title: Hardware - FSUSciComp
URL: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/hardware

The Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) maintains computing hardware in a robust machine room on the fourth floor of Dirac Science Library. Most of this hardware is owned by DSC and non-DSC research groups and is dedicated to a wide range of research problems.

*   **Idle Cycle Access:** DSC faculty and students can access idle cycles on owner-based machines using a system called **condor**. The condor system matches single-process non-interactive batch submissions to any idle CPUs in the DSC machine room or on DSC desktop machines.
*   **General Access Machines:** These are available to DSC faculty and students to compile software and run interactive jobs (e.g., MatLab).
*   **Managed Facilities:** The DSC manages and supports a general access visualization lab and FSU's shared HPC facility.

**Learn More:**
*   General Access
*   Facilities, Computational Infrastructure

### Title: Interactive - FSUSciComp
URL: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/interactive

DSC students, faculty, and students in Computational Science courses can interactively access computers in DSL 152 and the hallway via SSH.

**How to Run an Interactive Job:**
1.  Open an X11 terminal and type one of the following commands:
    *   `qlogin`
    *   `hallway` (to access hallway nodes only)
    *   `classroom` (to access classroom nodes only)
2.  After authenticating, type the name of the program you want to run (e.g., `matlab`).

**If `qlogin` is not available on your machine:**
1.  SSH to a DSC desktop or hallway machine: `ssh -X hallway-a.sc.fsu.edu`
2.  Then follow the instructions above.

**Access Policy:**
*   1 job per user.

**Availability:**
*   **Classroom queues:** Available except for Mon - Fri, 7:45 AM to 6:00 PM. All remote classroom sessions are terminated at 7:45 AM on weekdays.
*   **Hallway queues:** Available 24/7.
*   **To specify a queue:** Use `qlogin -q classroom` or `qlogin -q hallway`.

**Note:** The classroom and hallway machines are for student assignments, not for production-level jobs. Use FSU's HPC system (http://rcc.fsu.edu) for production batch schedule jobs.

**Supported Submission Tools:**

### Title: Visualization - FSUSciComp
URL: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/visualization

The visualization laboratory is a DSC facility available for all researchers at Florida State University. The goal is to provide tools to analyze data, extract features, and display data meaningfully.

**Use Categories:**
*   Visualization Research
*   Visualization Education
*   Application of Visualization

**Access Methods:**
1.  **Work within the visualization lab:** Utilize dual large screens and a 12 TByte local storage facility.
2.  **Remote access:** Use SSH connections and X-Window tunneling. The Vis Lab is also testing new HP software for full graphics remote access from Linux or Windows desktops.

**Education:**
Visualization is an integral component of the research workflow, used to:
*   Construct computational grids
*   Check data for accuracy
*   Analyze and extract features from simulation data
*   Ask questions of the data

**Research Areas of Interest:**
*   Real-time rendering using graphics hardware
*   Remote and collaborative visualization
*   Pattern recognition and feature extraction
*   Information visualization and visual realism
*   Visualization of uncertainty, stochastic multi-dimensional processes, and higher-dimensional data
*   Computer Vision

Most department computing resources are accessible from `pamd.sc.fsu.edu`.

**Connecting to Application Servers:**
*   From `pamd`, use the `hallway`, `classroom`, or `cil` command.
*   The `qlogin` command is also available on desktop workstations (e.g., dskscsXXX.sc.fsu.edu).

**Connecting to Departmental Desktops:**
*   From `pamd` or `pamd2`, use `ssh dskscsXXX.sc.fsu.edu`.
