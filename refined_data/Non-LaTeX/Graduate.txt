### General Overview of the Department of Scientific Computing (FSUSciComp)

The Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) at Florida State University (FSU) offers innovative, interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate training programs. The focus is on the invention, implementation, testing, and application of algorithms and software to solve large-scale scientific and engineering problems. The department faculty comes from diverse disciplines, including biology, engineering, geology, mathematics, and physics.

**Key Distinction:** Computational science is different from computer science. Computer science is about the science of computers, whereas computational science is about using computers to solve problems in science and engineering.

**Degrees Offered:**
*   Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computational Science
*   Minor in Computational Science
*   Master of Science (M.S.) in Computational Science
*   Master of Science (M.S.) in Interdisciplinary Data Science (IDS)
