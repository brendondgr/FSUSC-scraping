Feel free to copy relevant portions of this text into your research proposals.
The Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) plays a major role in the support of FSU's cyberinfrastructure by providing facilities and technical expertise in the support of scientific computing. The DSC manages a dedicated computing facility located on the main FSU campus in Dirac Science Library. The DSC facility provides a highly flexible computing environment designed to support specialized and experimental hardware and software systems.

*   **DSC Computing Facility:**
    The DSC facility supports an assortment of computer architectures, interconnects, and operating systems. Systems hosted in the DSC facility are owned by DSC and are dedicated to a wide range of research problems including; machine learning, neuroscience, molecular biophysics, evolutionary biology, network modeling, and Monte-Carlo algorithm development. The DSC facility is equipped with two 40-ton HVAC cooling units, 1000 ft^2 of raised floor, an extensive power distribution system, UPS battery backup systems, and a 550 KVA diesel-powered backup generator. The DSC network is built on a 10 Gbps backbone and connects via 100 Gbps to the FSU campus backbone, which in turn connects to the Florida/National LamdaRail.

*   **FSU RCC (formerly the Shared-HPC):**
    Access the latest RCC facilities statement at: https://its.fsu.edu/help/it-support/researchers#grants

*   **Scientific Visualization:**
    The DSC supports a general access laboratory for scientific visualization and computational intelligence on the fourth floor of the Dirac Science Library (DSL). The lab hosts high-end visualization workstations with GPU video cards (CUDA SDK compatible) and access to multi-terabyte shared high-performance storage. It also includes a high-resolution laser projection system in the main seminar room, featuring a 4K Enhancement Technology projector on an 18' x 8' screen.

*   **General DSC Infrastructure:**
    The DSC provides office space for faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and support personnel, with all offices equipped with a desktop computer and network connections. The department also supports a cutting-edge classroom with 19 Intel-based workstations (Linux/Windows), a large seminar room for 80 people with a 4K laser projection system, and two conference rooms with large high-definition displays.

*   **DSC Classroom:**
    The classroom is equipped with 20 new systems, each featuring an Intel® Core™ i9-10940X processor (3.30GHz, 14 cores), 64GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU, ideal for machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

**Page Title:** Linux Modules - FSUSciComp
**URL:** https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1177-linux-modules

**Content:**
On our Linux systems, software resources are made available via modules, which configure the shell environment for an application.

    *   **List available modules:** `module avail` or `ls /etc/modulefiles/*`
    *   **Load a module:** `module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64`
    *   **List loaded modules:** `module list`
    *   **Unload a module:** `module unload mpi/openmpi-x86_64`

*   **Creating Custom Modules:**
    1.  Create a directory for your modules: `mkdir ~/modules`
    2.  Add the path to your shell's startup file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.cshrc`).
        *   **bash:** `export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:${HOME}/modules`
        *   **csh/tcsh:** `setenv MODULEPATH ${MODULEPATH}:${HOME}/modules`
    3.  Create a modulefile. It can be a simple script setting environment variables like `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. You can use existing files in `/etc/modulefiles` as templates.

*   **Example Modulefile Directives:**
    ```tcl
    #%Module 1.0
    module-whatis  "Set path for orca."
    prepend-path   PATH /panfs/storage.local/opt/orca_3_0_0_linux_x86-64
    setenv         RSH_COMMAND ssh

**Note:** Passwordless authentication is disabled on `pamd` servers, but can be set up for other hosts once inside the network.

*   **Passwordless Authentication (OpenSSH to OpenSSH):**
    1.  Generate a key: `ssh-keygen -t dsa` (leave passphrase blank).
    2.  This creates `~/.ssh/id_dsa` (private) and `~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub` (public).
    3.  Append the public key to the remote host's `authorized_keys2` file:
        `cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2`
    4.  If the remote host doesn't mount your home directory, copy the public key over first.

*   **OpenSSH to ssh.com:**
    1.  Convert the OpenSSH public key to SECSH format: `ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub > ~/.ssh/id_dsa_secsh.pub`
    2.  On the remote host, create `~/.ssh2` if it doesn't exist.
    3.  Copy the new key (`id_dsa_secsh.pub`) to the remote `~/.ssh2` directory.
    4.  Create or append to the remote `~/.ssh2/authorization` file: `echo Key id_dsa_secsh.pub >> authorization`

*   **ssh.com to OpenSSH:**
    1.  On the local host: `ssh-keygen -t dsa`, then create `~/.ssh2/identification` with `IdKey id_dsa_1024_a`.
    2.  Copy the public key (`id_dsa_1024_a.pub`) to the remote host's `~/.ssh/` directory.
    3.  On the remote host, convert the key and append to `authorized_keys2`:
        `ssh-keygen -f id_dsa_1024_a.pub -i > newkey.pub`
        `cat newkey.pub >> authorized_keys2`

    *   A: Contact Michele Locke to arrange for additional credit.
*   **Q: Why won't my job print from my personal laptop?**
    *   A: Ensure your local username matches your SC/FSU username. Use the `lpr -U` flag if needed. Also, ensure you are on the correct network (e.g., via VPN).
*   **Q: Why is my print job stuck in the queue?**
    *   A: The printer might be busy with copying/scanning, or another job is printing. Email [email protected] if it needs attention.

*   **How do I get an account on a cluster?**
    *   If you have a DSC account, request access through SCUM. If not, request a sponsored DSC account first.
*   **How do I log into the cluster?**
    *   Access cluster resources through the headnode via `ssh`. From outside the DSC network, you must first log into `pamd.sc.fsu.edu`.
*   **How do I compile programs?**
    *   Use the cluster headnode to compile. Your default path will be set correctly.
*   **How do I run programs?**
    *   Submit all programs via the cluster's queuing system. Do NOT run resource-intensive programs directly on the headnode.
*   **How do I log into a specific node?**
    *   Use the queuing system: `qlogin -q [queue-name]` or `qlogin -q [queue-name]@[machine-name]`.
*   **What are the differences between MPI implementations?**
    *   OpenMPI is recommended for new development. Other implementations are available on certain clusters but may be less scheduler-friendly.
