\section{Education Overview}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/education}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computational Science
    \item Master of Science (M.S.) in Computational Science
    \item Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computational Science
    \item Minor in Computational Science
    \item Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Fire Dynamics
    \item Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
    \item Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Science
\end{itemize}

The educational mission of the Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) is to provide innovative, interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate training programs in computational science and its applications. The graduate and undergraduate degree programs in the DSC are designed to provide students with a broad training in the design, implementation, and use of algorithms for solving science and engineering problems on computers.

\subsection{The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree}
The Department of Scientific Computing offers an innovative \textbf{Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree program in Computational Science}.

This degree program should be of interest to and is well suited for those who like working on computers and who ordinarily would also be interested in any of the mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), or any of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, geological sciences, ...), or any engineering discipline. It should be of special interest to students interested in two or more of these areas. Students majoring in Computational Science will learn how to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.

Please note that \textit{computational science} is \textit{different} from \textit{computer science}. At the risk of oversimplifying things, one can say that computer science is about the science of computers whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.

\subsection{The Minor degree}
The Minor in Computational Science offers a substantive programming and algorithmic knowledge base to non-Computational Science students.

Students who minor in the discipline will develop critical computing and modeling skills that are marketable and attractive to potential employers.

The minor requires at least 14 hours of coursework, and students must make a C- or above in each class for the course to be accepted for minor credit.

\subsection{The Master of Science (M.S.) degrees}
\begin{itemize}
    \item M.S. in Computational Science
    \item M.S. in Data Science
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree}
The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree consists of several majors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ph.D. in Computational Science
    \begin{itemize}
        \item with a Specialization in Atmospheric Science
        \item with a Specialization in Biochemistry
        \item with a Specialization in Biological Science
        \item with a Specialization in Geological Science
        \item with a Specialization in Materials Science
        \item with a Specialization in Physics
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Students who choose the first major specialize in the more mathematical or computer science aspects of computational science.

Because computational science lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, applied science, engineering, and computer science, the DSC has the unique ability to offer coursework and research opportunities at all levels in topic areas that cut across disciplines. The focus of the research and training activities of the DSC is on the invention, analysis, and implementation of computational algorithms that transcend disciplines and the application of such algorithms to various applications, including, among others, astrophysics, bioinformatics, climate and weather modeling, computational fluid mechanics, computational geometry, computer game design, evolutionary biology, data mining, GPU computing, high-energy density physics, high-performance computing, hydrology, machine learning, material science, medical imaging, morphometrics, nano-materials, numerical analysis, partial differential equations, phylogenetics, polymers, population genetics, scientific visualization, subsurface environmental modeling, superconductivity, systems biology, and uncertainty quantification.

Unlike the faculty of a typical department whose training and research interests lie solely within a single discipline, the faculty of the DSC includes members trained in a variety of disciplines - biology, aeronautical engineering, chemical engineering, geological sciences, electrical engineering, material sciences, mathematics, nuclear engineering, and physics. In addition, the DSC has several affiliated faculty members in other departments at FSU and at other universities, companies, and laboratories that further enhance the educational and research experiences of students in the DSC's degree programs.

In addition to offering degree programs, the DSC contributes to FSU's educational mission by offering courses of interest to students in other departments, by offering tutorials and short courses, and by managing high-performance computational resources available to the campus community.

\section{Chair's Introduction}
% https://www.sc.fsu.edu/chairs-intro

\begin{center}
    Welcome to the \\
    \textbf{Department of Scientific Computing} \\
    at \\
    \textbf{Florida State University!}
\end{center}

When I became a scientist many years ago, computers were still very special for most of us, and only a few would train and use computers for research. This has changed profoundly! Today, we cannot imagine doing science without computers. Most mundane tasks are now run on computers; our cell phones have morphed into mobile pocket computers with power many times beyond the mainframe computers of the 1980s. In 2022, digital computers have matured and become part of our society. The future may bring versatile quantum computers soon, replacing our current computers.

Today computing and theory development often go hand-in-hand, and our department of Scientific Computing is at this junction where theory and computation intersect. Several in our department work on modeling processes and improving the precision and calculation time to achieve accurate predictions of the actual processes. These include work on detecting tumors, explaining the flow of forest fires, or describing details of star explosions or evolutionary patterns.

Our department is interdisciplinary at its core: as of 2022, our faculty consists of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, engineers, material scientists, and computer scientists. We use computers as a tool to improve theory, calculations, modeling, and inference. Our educational mission includes an undergraduate program in computational science that emphasizes the interaction of mathematics, computing, and problem-solving. We also have three graduate programs: a doctoral program in computational science, a master's program in computational science, and a master's program in datascience. The datascience program is a collaboration with 3 other departments on campus.

Explore our website, and learn about our computational science and datascience programs. Feel free to contact us to establish a dialogue. In particular, we would like to hear from you if you are a prospective student seeking to participate in our Departmental programs and activities and become a part of a discipline that changes the world.

\section{Degree Programs Overview}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/ms}

The educational mission of the Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) is to provide innovative, interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate training programs in computational science and its applications. The graduate and undergraduate degree programs in the DSC are designed to provide students with a broad training in the design, implementation, and use of algorithms for solving science and engineering problems on computers.

\subsection*{The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree}
The Department of Scientific Computing offers an innovative \textbf{Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree program in Computational Science}.

This degree program should be of interest to and is well suited for those who like working on computers and who ordinarily would also be interested in any of the mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), or any of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, geological sciences, ...), or any engineering discipline. It should be of special interest to students interested in two or more of these areas. Students majoring in Computational Science will learn how to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.

Please note that \textit{computational science} is \textit{different} from \textit{computer science}. At the risk of oversimplifying things, one can say that computer science is about the science of computers whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.

\subsection*{The Minor degree}

Because computational science lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, applied science, engineering, and computer science, the DSC has the unique ability to offer coursework and research opportunities at all levels in topic areas that cut across disciplines. The focus of the research and training activities of the DSC is on the invention, analysis, and implementation of computational algorithms that transcend disciplines and the application of such algorithms to various applications, including, among others, astrophysics, bioinformatics, climate and weather modeling, computational fluid mechanics, computational geometry, computer game design, evolutionary biology, data mining, GPU computing, high-energy density physics, high-performance computing, hydrology, machine learning, material science, medical imaging, morphometrics, nano-materials, numerical analysis, partial differential equations, phylogenetics, polymers, population genetics, scientific visualization, subsurface environmental modeling, superconductivity, systems biology, and uncertainty quantification.

Unlike the faculty of a typical department whose training and research interests lie solely within a single discipline, the faculty of the DSC includes members trained in a variety of disciplines - biology, aeronautical engineering, chemical engineering, geological sciences, electrical engineering, material sciences, mathematics, nuclear engineering, and physics. In addition, the DSC has several affiliated faculty members in other departments at FSU and at other universities, companies, and laboratories that further enhance the educational and research experiences of students in the DSC's degree programs.

In addition to offering degree programs, the DSC contributes to FSU's educational mission by offering courses of interest to students in other departments, by offering tutorials and short courses, and by managing high-performance computational resources available to the campus community.

\section{Undergraduate Programs}

\subsection{Undergraduate Overview}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/undergraduate/overview}

The Department of Scientific Computing offers an innovative \textbf{B.S. degree program in Computational Science}.

This degree program should be of interest to and is well suited for those who like working on computers and who ordinarily would also be interested in any of the mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), or any of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, geological sciences, ...), or any engineering discipline. It should be of special interest to students interested in two or more of these areas. Students majoring in Computational Science will learn how to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.

The \textbf{Department of Scientific Computing} is the focal point of computational science activities at FSU. Computational science involves the invention, implementation, testing, and application of algorithms and software used to solve large-scale scientific and engineering problems. The Department provides a venue for innovative research and education in computational science. Our faculty come from a wide variety of traditional mathematical, scientific, and engineering disciplines who are primarily interested in developing knowledge and tools for computational science and applying those tools to the solution of problems in a variety of applications.

Please note that computational science is different from computer science. At the risk of oversimplifying things, one can say that computer science is about the science of computers whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.

The undergraduate \textbf{Minor} and \textbf{B.S.} degree programs in Computational Science, along with the already established \textbf{Master's} and \textbf{Ph.D.} programs, trains students in computational science by providing them with a mix of theory and practice, including substantial hands-on experience in the deployment and use of algorithms for solving scientific and engineering problems.

Questions should be sent to \texttt{<email protected>}. Anyone in the neighborhood interested in knowing more about the undergraduate degree program is welcome to stop by the Department offices located on the 4th floor of the Dirac Science Library.

\subsection{Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computational Science}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/phd}

Many of the important problems facing society today can only be solved by teams of individuals from a variety of disciplines. An individual trained in an interdisciplinary environment is an essential member of such a team because he/she can successfully interact with team members and gain an overall understanding of the problem.

However, most doctoral programs in this country have a very narrow focus and consequently, students rarely have the opportunity to understand research themes in other disciplines or even to explore the relevance of their own research to other fields. Since the Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, applied science, computer science and engineering, it has the unique opportunity to train students in areas which cut across disciplines.

\subsubsection*{Ph.D Program Tracks}
The goal of the Ph.D. program in Computational Science is to train graduate students to have extensive knowledge in computational science and to allow the student to acquire expertise in one or more areas of the sciences, mathematics, or engineering. Students may choose to follow the major track in computational science which allows them to specialize in aspects of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item computational mathematics
    \item computer science
\end{itemize}
relevant to computational science or choose to complete one of the following specialized tracks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ph.D. in Computational Science with a Specialization in \textbf{Atmospheric Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Biochemistry}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Biological Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Geological Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Materials Science}
    \item with a Specialization in \textbf{Physics}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Coursework \& credits}
Since computational science is an interdisciplinary program, students' programs of study can be quite varied. Consequently, we have built in a lot of flexibility into the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Computational Science. The commonality in the coursework is that each student must take the same four computational science courses (Group A courses), which cut across disciplines, as well as a minimum of 9 credit hours in other computational science courses (Group B courses) plus 9 additional credit hours selected from existing departmental courses in computer science, engineering, mathematics or an applied science (Group C courses). Each student must also take six seminar hours (details are listed in the Graduate Handbook, section 5.2.2).

There are a total of 29 credit hours of coursework that are specified plus a minimum of 24 credits of dissertation hours. A specialization is obtained by completing a minimum of 9 credit hours from courses in the discipline approved by the student's supervisory committee.

The \textbf{required core courses (Group A)} consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to Scientific Programming (3 credits)
    \item Applied Computational Science I (4 credits)
    \item Applied Computational Science II (4 credits)
    \item Parallel Programming, Algorithms and Architectures (3 credits)
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{elective core courses (Group B)} consist of courses such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo/Markov Chain Simulations
    \item Survey of Numerical PDEs
    \item Computational Space Physics
    \item Programming Skills for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
    \item Computational Evolutionary Biology
    \item Introduction to Bioinformatics
    \item Computational Finite Element Methods
    \item Numerical Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations
    \item Numerical Methods for Earth and Environmental Sciences
    \item Molecular Dynamics
    \item Numerical Linear Algebra
    \item Data mining
    \item Visualization
    \item Verification and Validation in Computational Science
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} Student should select a minimum of three courses from Group B, which are approved by his/her supervisory committee.

\subsubsection*{Application and Information}
Students applying to this program should have earned a bachelor's or master's degree in an applied science, mathematics, computer science or engineering and possess a keen interest in computational science. The DSC expect that graduates of this program will be prepared to seek employment in academic, industrial, or laboratory settings.

\subsubsection{Specialization in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics}
\texttt{url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/phd/gfd}

\paragraph{PROGRAM OVERVIEW} The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program leads to a degree in Computational Sciences with a major in either GFD or Fire Dynamics. It is an interdisciplinary field of study whose primary goal is an improvement in our basic understanding of fluid flows that occur naturally, including such topics as climate and paleoclimate, biogeochemical processes, hydrology and Karst dynamics, air-sea interaction, wild fire dynamics, double diffusive processes, and hurricane dynamics with strong links to the Applied Mathematics Program. The approach to this understanding is through quantitative analysis of observational records and theoretical, mathematical, numerical, and experimenting modeling. A geophysical fluid dynamicist must have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of classical physics, knowledge of the techniques of applied mathematics, and an interest in the natural sciences.

\paragraph{FACILITIES} These facilities include a large modern laboratory for hydrodynamics experiments, a colloquium room and reading room, a photographic and illustrations laboratory, a large modern machine shop, a precision instrument-makers laboratory, and faculty and student offices.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Biological Sciences
    \item Population Genetics
    \item Phylogenetics
    \item Bayesian inference
    \item Model selection
\end{itemize}

I started out my science career as a practical evolutionary biologist working with frogs on islands in the mediterranean sea. There was no good analysis software for my data available at that time. Therefore, in 1994, I started a career as a computational biologist developing software (MIGRATE: https://popgen.sc.fsu.edu) for other biologists to analyze large-scale DNA datasets and compare different evolutionary hypotheses. My interests have centered on the coalescent and how we can use that to infer parameters of population genetic models and also compare them statistically.

\section{Computing}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing}

The Department of Scientific Computing maintains a large and dynamic computing infrastructure in support of research and education.

Computing resources include the FSU RCC/HPC, a number of clusters and computational servers, a laboratory for scientific visualization, a bioinformatics server, and more. While many of the department's computing resources are dedicated to specific research areas, an increasing number of machines are being made available to the University research community in general through the use of high throughput management tools and job schedulers.

\subsection{Getting Started}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/getting-started}

For new users getting started in our department the following technical documents should be read first:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Getting an account
    \item Logging in to SC systems
    \item Changing your password or environment
    \item Configuring Email
    \item Personal Website Hosting
    \item Account Policy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/hardware}

The Department of Scientific Computing maintains computing hardware in a robust machine room on the fourth floor of Dirac Science Library. Most the hardware in this machine room is owned by DSC and non-DSC research groups and is dedicated to a wide range of research problems including; molecular biophysics, evolutionary biology, network modeling, and Monte-Carlo algorithm development. DSC faculty and students can access the idle cycles on the owner based machines by using a system called \texttt{condor}. The \texttt{condor system} is configured to match single process non-interactive batch submissions to any idle CPUs hosted in the DSC machine room or in DSC desktop machines. Some general access machines are made available to DSC faculty and students to compile software and to run interactive jobs, e.g., MatLab. Also, the DSC manages and supports a general access visualization lab and FSU's shared HPC facility. To learn more about the hardware resources hosted or managed by DSC, click on one of the links below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item General Access
    \item Facilities, Computational Infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Access}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access}

The Department of Scientific Computing manages and supports a number of general access facilities for DSC faculty and students as well the University computing in general. Click on any of the links below to learn more about these resources.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interactive
    \item Visualization
    \item High Performance Computing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{High Performance Computing (RCC)}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/hpc}

\paragraph{The Research Computing Center (RCC)} - formerly known as the FSU shared-HPC facility - enables multidisciplinary computing for the FSU research community. To learn more about this facility please see the RCC web site.
\begin{itemize}
    \item RCC Homepage
    \item High-performance Computing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interactive}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/interactive}

DSC students, faculty, and students taking Computational Science courses can interactively access the computers located in DSL 152 and the hallway via \texttt{ssh}. This allows you to request interactive resources and it will randomly instantiate a session on a workstation. What follows is a quick start for the DSC environment.

\paragraph{How to Run an Interactive Job}
Open an X11 terminal and type:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{qlogin}
    \item OR
    \item \texttt{hallway} (to access hallway nodes only)
    \item \texttt{classroom} (to access classroom nodes only)
\end{itemize}

After authenticating, type the name of the program you want to run, e.g., \texttt{matlab}.

If \texttt{qlogin} is not available on your machine, you must run the above commands from a DSC desktop. SSH to a DSC desktop or hallway machine:
\texttt{ssh -X hallway-a.sc.fsu.edu}

Then follow the above instructions.

\paragraph{Access Policy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 job per user
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Availability}
Classroom queues are available with the exception of Mon - Fri 7:45 AM till 6:00 PM.
Hallway queues are available 24/7.
To guarantee which queue you land in please use either \texttt{qlogin -q classroon} or \texttt{qlogin -q hallway}.

\textbf{NOTE:} All remote classroom sessions will be terminated at 7:45 AM M-F. The purpose of the classroom and hallway machines is primarily for students to do their assignments - not as a production engine. Use FSU's HPC system (\url{http://rcc.fsu.edu}) for production batch schedule jobs.

\subsubsection{Visualization}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/general-access/visualization}

It is said that "A picture is worth a thousand words". How true. The ultimate goal of scientific visualization is to provide scientists with tools that permit them to analyze their data, extract information/features, correlate that information, and display their data in a meaningful way. More importantly, visualization encourages the scientists to ask questions. The more interactive an application, the more questions a scientist can pose. Application areas with large scale datasets (steady or time-dependent) include oceanography, study of hurricanes, data assimilation techniques, phylogenetic tree evolution, geophysics, fluid dynamics, and more.

The visualization laboratory is a DSC facility available for the use of researchers across the entire Florida State University Campus. Use is divided into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualization Research
    \item Visualization Education
    \item Application of Visualization
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Applications}
The laboratory is open to all researchers of Florida State University who have a need to visualize and analyze their simulation or other data. Be sure to check out the tutorial section of this web site. This access can take several forms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Work within the visualization lab}, making use of dual large screens for maximum flexibility during the generation and rendering of large scale imagery and the generation of sophisticated animations. User data resides on our local 12 TByte storage facility.
    \item \textbf{Remote access to the visualization laboratory from desktop computers or workstations}. Typically this involves remote SSH connections and X-Window tunneling to run applications on the visualization machines from another location--this does not fully support hardware based graphics. During the coming months the Vis Lab will be testing innovative new software from HP, which allows users to execute any software that runs locally from a remote desktop Linux or windows machine in full graphics mode. As in the first case, data would be stored on our local file system for maximum efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Education}
Perhaps most importantly, visualization is an integral component of the workflow adopted by researchers around the world. Visualization is necessary to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item construct computational grids that discretize the physical domain,
    \item check data for accuracy, correctness
    \item analyze simulation data
    \item extract features from simulation data
    \item ask questions of the data
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Research}
Scientists are encourage to use the laboratory for advanced research in the area of scientific visualization. Areas of interest include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real time rendering using graphics hardware
    \item Remote rendering
    \item Collaborative visualization
    \item Pattern recognition
    \item Feature extraction
    \item Information visualization
    \item Visual realism
    \item Visualization of uncertainty
    \item Visualization of stochastic multi-dimensional processes
    \item Visualization of higher dimensional data (four and above)
    \item and more ...
    \item Computer Vision
\end{itemize}

\section{BLAS}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/339-blas}

The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (\href{http://www.netlib.org/blas/}{BLAS}) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software, \href{http://www.netlib.org/lapack/}{LAPACK} for example. The libraries are typically linked into your application. For example,if the libraries are stored on \texttt{/usr/local/lib}, use \texttt{-L/usr/local/lib -lf77blas} in your program linker step to link to these libraries. Detailed lists of functions can be found on the links above.

The "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West" (FFTW) is a C library for computing discrete Fourier transforms (DFT). Note that there are two main versions of FFTW, version 2 and version 3 which are not compatible. The basic usage of FFTW to compute a one-dimensional DFT of size N is simple, and it typically looks something like this code:
\begin{verbatim}
#include <fftw.h>
...
{
    fftw_complex *in, *out;
    fftw_plan p;
    ...
    in = (fftw_complex*) fftw_malloc(sizeof(fftw_complex) * N);
    out = (fftw_complex*) fftw_malloc(sizeof(fftw_complex) * N);
    p = fftw_plan_dft_1d(N, in, out, FFTW_FORWARD, FFTW_ESTIMATE);
    ...
    fftw_execute(p); /* repeat as needed */
    ...
    fftw_destroy_plan(p);
    fftw_free(in);
    fftw_free(out);
}

\section{Redhat Software Collections}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1017-redhat-software-collections}

Sometimes more recent versions of programming tools are needed. To accomodate that without replacing the base operating system tools, Redhat has implemented software collections. This allows users to run gcc 4.9.x, python 2.7.x, etc. on a per application basis while maintaining well-tested operating system integrity.

The \texttt{scl} utility makes the switching simple.

The current gcc version is 4.4. To use gcc 4.9 in bash shell, run the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
scl enable devtoolset-4 bash
gcc -v
gfortran -v
\end{verbatim}
Likewise to use python 3.6, run the following:
\begin{verbatim}
scl enable rh-python36 bash
python -V
\end{verbatim}
By exiting that bash shell, users will return back to the default system tools.

Other useful commands:
\begin{verbatim}
cat my_script | scl enable rh-python36 -
scl -l devtoolset-4
\end{verbatim}
The first command runs \texttt{my\_script} using python3.6 from the current shell (note the dash in the end). The second lists the packages included in collection \texttt{devtoolset-4}.

For starters, let's get python to run the eponymous hello world program. The first thing to do is navigate to your preferred source code storage location, and write the hello world program.
Then, start the command prompt.
And then navigate to your program location.
Then, run the python interpreter.

\subsection*{Other Features}
At some point you may build up a code library that you would like to reference. Python contains options to ease the reuse of old code. In order to explore these options, lets compute the factorial of five. First, go to your prefered source directory, and write the program. The program is split up into two files: one that contains a factorial algorithm inside a module, and one that makes use of that module. The two files are split into disparate directories.

Start up the command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the main program. Now, whenever python runs, it searches for code libraries based on the environment variables \texttt{PYTHON\_HOME} and \texttt{PYTHON\_PATH}. In order for python to be able to find the factorial function, its folder must be on the \texttt{PYTHON\_PATH}. So, set the variable (on Windows, setting a variable in the command prompt only affects that command prompt).

Now just run the main program, and you should find that 5! = 120.

\section{Linux Modules}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1177-linux-modules}

On our Linux systems, most software resources are made available via modules. Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the \texttt{module} command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as \texttt{PATH}, \texttt{MANPATH}, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the shared modulefiles.

This allows us to offer a large array of software to many users without the packages interfering with each other.

\subsection*{Using built-in modules}
We provide many built-in modules for loading software packages and compilers. You can see a list of these by running
\begin{verbatim}
$ ls /etc/modulefiles/*
\end{verbatim}
OR
\begin{verbatim}
$ module avail
\end{verbatim}
on any Desktop, Hallway, or Classroom workstation.

Let's say, for example, you wish to use MPI. You can use the \texttt{/etc/modulefiles/mpi/openmpi-x86\_64} to make openmpi available to your shell.

To do this, simply run:
\begin{verbatim}
$ module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64
\end{verbatim}
To show the current list of loaded modules, run:
\begin{verbatim}
$ module list
\end{verbatim}
If you want to unload a module, run:
\begin{verbatim}
$ module unload mpi/openmpi-x86_64
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Creating custom modules}
You may wish to customize the Linux environment for your jobs on your own. You can create your own custom module to accomplish this.

First, create a directory for your modules:
\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir ~/modules
\end{verbatim}
Then, add the module path to the end of your \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.bashrc} file:
\begin{verbatim}
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:${HOME}/modules
\end{verbatim}
or add the following to your \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.cshrc} or \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.tcshrc} if you use the tcsh shell:
\begin{verbatim}
setenv MODULEPATH ${MODULEPATH}:${HOME}/modules
\end{verbatim}
A module can be as simple as setting a few environment variables (such as \texttt{PATH} and \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}) or can be complicated Tcl scripts.

You can refer to any of our existing modules in the \texttt{/etc/modulefiles} directory as templates for creating your own. For example, the \texttt{/etc/modulefiles/orca} module includes the following directives:

Provide basic information about what the module does:
\begin{verbatim}
#%Module 1.0
#
#  Orca module
#
module-whatis  "Set path for orca."
\end{verbatim}
Add the ORCA executable directory to the path, so that ORCA runs when the 'orca' command is typed:
\begin{verbatim}
prepend-path   PATH /panfs/storage.local/opt/orca_3_0_0_linux_x86-64
\end{verbatim}
Set an environment variable necessary for ORCA to run:
\begin{verbatim}
setenv         RSH_COMMAND ssh
\end{verbatim}
Running \texttt{module load orca} will make those alterations to the environment. running \texttt{module unload orca} will remove them.

For a more complex example, refer to \texttt{/etc/modulefiles/gaussian09}. This module file examines what architecture the module is run and adjusts its paths accordingly.

For a complete reference of module file directives, refer to the modulefile man page (\texttt{man modulefile}).

\section{VirtualBox Issues}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1185-virtualbox-issues}

If you have trouble accessing VMs provided, please email \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu} for help or search "virtualbox" from the site.

\subsection*{Inaccessible Disk / Existing UUID}
If you should encounter an error saying that the virtual machine disk is inaccessible or that a disk with this UUID already exists, this can be fixed by removing the disk and adding it back.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Right click on the virtual machine in the left pane of the VirtualBox Manager and click Settings. Navigate to the Storage section.
    \item Right click the .vdi image and click Remove Attachment.
    \item Right click "Controller: SATA" and click "Add Hard Disk." Click "Choose existing disk."
    \item Navigate to the virtual machine .vdi file and press "Open."
\end{enumerate}

\section{VirtualBox File Management}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1186-virtualbox-file-management}

When using Windows virtual machines provided on Linux Workstations, you are strongly recommended to save data per session.
\textbf{All data will be lost} when the virtual machine is rebuilt as needed without notice. There are several ways through which you can save files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your home directory
    \item Dropbox
    \item Google Drive
    \item One Drive
    \item USB
\end{itemize}
To save works in your home directory, you need to set it up \textbf{before} starting the virtual machine.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start "Oralce VM VirtualBox"
    \item Select VM to be used, open “Settings”, go to Shared Folders
    \item Click on the icon with blue folder and plus sign
    \item Folder Path: \texttt{/home/username/...}
    \item Folder Name: MyDescription
    \item Check "Make Permanent"
    \item Click on "OK" to finish or add other shared folders if needed
\end{enumerate}
Now you are ready to start Windows VM and save files in the home directory: under "Network / VBOXSVR / MyDescription", the UNC equivalent: \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}VBOXSVR\textbackslash{}MyDescription}.

To save files on USB, your can use "Shared Folders" similar to home directory.

\section{Linux Commands Cheat Sheet}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1302-linux-commands-cheatsheet}

Below are a number of commonly used commands in unix. For almost every command, there are additional flags that can be used to modify the command's behavior. For example, typing \texttt{ls} in the terminal displays the files contained within the current working directory, but \texttt{ls -l} displays them in a list format. Additionally, \texttt{ls -lt} displays them in a list, but also in order of modification time. Information on what flags can be used, along with general explanations about the commands, can be found by typing \texttt{man} before the command. Ex: \texttt{man ls}.

\subsection*{Navigation}
Basic navigation is performed using a few commands:
\begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{cd}:] Short for 'change directory', changes the current working directory.
    \item[\texttt{ls}:] Short for 'list', lists all of the files in the current working directory.
    \item[\texttt{cwd}:] Short for 'current working directory', lists the absolute path to the directory the user is in.
    \item[\texttt{clear}:] Clears the terminal of all text, although the previous text can still be seen by scrolling up.
\end{description}
In navigating a Unix file structure, a number of shorthand notations should be mentioned. Example usage of the above commands are shown here as well:
\begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}:] The location of a user's home directory. When logging into a unix machine, you are likely going to begin in your home directory, where your personal files will be located. Typing \texttt{ls} while in the home directory will display folders like \texttt{Desktop}, \texttt{Pictures}, \texttt{Downloads}, and \texttt{Documents}. To move into one of these folders, one can type, e.g., \texttt{cd Downloads}. Additionally, to display the contents of the \texttt{Downloads} folder without navigating to it, type \texttt{ls Downloads}.
    \item[\texttt{/}:] The machine's root directory. This is the highest level directory that contains all other files and folders in the machine. Programming libraries, system files, etc are found within the folders here. Typing \texttt{cwd} in any directory will display the path from the root directory to the current working directory. For example, if the user's name was 'tom', typing 'cwd' while in the 'Downloads' folder will display \texttt{/home/tom/Downloads}.
    \item[\texttt{.}:] The current directory is represented with a simple period. Typing \texttt{cd .} moves you to the current working directory, i.e. to where you are now.
    \item[\texttt{..}:] The directory above the current working directory. Ex: If you're in the directory \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Downloads/}, typing \texttt{cd ..} will bring you to the home directory.
    \item[\texttt{-}:] This represents the last directory you were in. Ex: If you were in \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Downloads} and moved to \texttt{/lib64/}, typing \texttt{cd -} would move you back to \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Downloads} and \texttt{ls -} would display the files within \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Downloads}.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Creating, deleting, moving, renaming files/folders}
\begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{mkdir}:] Short for 'make directory', creates a directory with a given name. Ex: \texttt{mkdir \textasciitilde{}/Desktop/DSC} creates a folder 'DSC' in the 'Desktop' folder in your home directory.
    \item[\texttt{rmdir}:] Short for 'remove directory', deletes a directory. Note that there are no backups, so be careful when using this command.
    \item[\texttt{touch}:] Generally used to create a file with a given name. Ex: \texttt{touch \textasciitilde{}/Downloads/example.txt} creates an empty file named 'example.txt' in the Downloads folder and closes it. This command was originally used to update the time a file was accessed/modified -- 'touching' it by opening it if it exists, not modifying anything, and closing it.
    \item[\texttt{cp}:] Short for 'copy', simply copies a file. Ex: If a file named 'example.txt' were in the Downloads folder and the Downloads folder is the current working directory, we could copy it into to the Desktop by using \texttt{cp example.txt \textasciitilde{}/Desktop/}. We could also rename the copy something else by using \texttt{cp example.txt \textasciitilde{}/Desktop/example2.txt}. To copy a folder, the \texttt{-rf} flag is required, as it needs to recursively copy all the files within the folder if they are present.
    \item[\texttt{mv}:] Short for 'move', moves a file from one place to another, and is often used to rename a file. This command effectively does the same thing as 'cp', only that the original file is removed.
    \item[\texttt{rm}:] Short for 'remove', deletes a file. Note that there are no backups of these files, so be careful when using this command. When deleting a directory, use \texttt{rm -rf} or \texttt{rmdir}.
    \item[\texttt{locate}:] Searches the entirety of the file structure for a file/directory with a given name.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Additional tips}
\begin{description}
    \item[Tab-completion:] When typing in commands, especially when trying to navigate file structures, using the tab key can auto-complete the names of files/folders if they are present. If nothing auto-completes after typing tab once, type it again to see all possible options. Similar to our example above under the 'cp' explanation, if we were to type 'ls \textasciitilde{}/Desktop/example' and hit tab twice, it would show 'example.txt' and 'example2.txt'. Typing in '.' would then let it auto-complete the word 'example.txt' after hitting tab again.
    \item[Arrows:] Use the up arrow to access previous commands that have been typed in. Using the down arrow after using the up arrow will go back down the list of commands.
    \item[Permissions:] A fundamental part of the unix file system is permissions (which cannot be fully explained here) and is generally accessed by using 'ls -l', i.e. displaying a folder's contents in list format. If you cannot read or modify a file, check the permissions. The permissions are on the left and dictate who can and cannot read (r), write (w), or execute (x) files in Unix (called access modes). Ex: If one has read access, the 'r' will be displayed. If one does not have read access, the 'r' column will be replaced with a dash '-'. Further, these are split into three sets. The first set of access modes are the permissions of the file's owner (the first name beside the permissions). The second set are the permissions of the file's group (the second name beside the permissions). The third set is the permissions for everyone else. Ex: If a file has only read access, the permissions would read '-r--r--r--'. This means that the user, the user's group, and anyone else can open and read the contents of the file. If it had read, write, and execute access for only the user, it would read '-rwxr--r--'. Here the user can open the file to read its contents, save edits to it, and execute it (if it's a program or a script), but everyone else can only read its contents. If it further had execute access for the user's group, it would read '-rwxr-xr--'. Finally, notice that all of these examples have a leading '-'. This is replaced with a 'd' only if it is a directory. In that case, the number beside the permissions would display how many files are in the folder.
\end{description}
A final example for a folder named 'DSC' with 3 files in it owned by a user named 'tom' in the group 'users' with read, write, and execute permissions for the user 'tom', read and execute permissions for the group 'users', and read permissions for everyone else, with a byte size of 1000 and last modified on August 1st, 2017, would be:
\begin{verbatim}
  drwxr-xr-- 3 tom users 1000 Aug 1 2017 DSC

\section{Shared Computer Policy}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1333-shared-computer-policy}

DSC offers hallway and classroom computers as shared resources to all users. For fair use of the public systems, hallway computers should be used interactively and remote sessions should not include long running (8 hours or more) or CPU intensive jobs; classroom computers may be used for remote jobs during non-business hours (7pm - 7am). Technical Support Group reserves the rights to terminate jobs on shared systems if they are deemed as abusive.

If you require more resources, please consider \href{https://rcc.fsu.edu/}{Research Computing Center} or other dedicated systems through faculty members.

\section{Python Jungle}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1416-python-jungle}

Python 2 will soon be obsolete. Python 3 can be a challenge to navigate. It is strongly recommended to use virtual environment to manage python projects. Don't use system python for your projects.

Here is an example to start a project named isc3313. This approach will isolate python issues to the specific environment without impacting anything else.
\begin{verbatim}
scl enable rh-python36 bash
virtualenv isc3313
source isc3313/bin/activate
\end{verbatim}
Manage anything needed for this project
\begin{verbatim}
pip install tensorflow...
\end{verbatim}
To exit the environment, run
\begin{verbatim}
deactivate
\end{verbatim}
To determine if you are running a particular Software Collection:
\begin{verbatim}
echo $X_SCLS
\end{verbatim}
To test a Software Collection state, use "\texttt{scl\_enabled rh-python36}" exit code.

To run script using python3.6 through Redhat Software Collection, use the following script template
\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/scl enable rh-python36 -- python3
import sys
version = "Python %d.%d" % (sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor)
print("You are running Python",version)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Upload files to DSC computers}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1653-upload-files-to-dsc-computers}

From off campus, you are able to upload files from personal computers or laptops to DSC computers.

\subsection*{Mac}
Open a terminal window in Mac, and first create the tunnel of transfer by providing your fsuid and remote computer name:
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -f -N -L 2222:remote_computer_name.sc.fsu.edu:22 your_fsuid@pamd.sc.fsu.edu
\end{verbatim}
Once the tunnel is established by providing credentials, you can start to upload or download as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -p 2222' /local_upload_folder fsuid@localhost:/remote_destination_directory
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -p 2222' fsuid@localhost:/remote_directory_to_be_downloaded /local_destination
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Windows 10}
Open a command Window, and establish the tunnel (NOTE the option -L):
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -f -N -L 2222:remote_computer_name.sc.fsu.edu your_fsuid@pamd.sc.fsu.edu
\end{verbatim}
Now you can upload or download files and/or folders as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
scp -r -P 2222 /local_source fsuid@localhost:/remote_destination
scp -r -P 2222 fsuid@localhost:/remote_directory_to_be_downloaded /local_destination

\section{OneDrive for Ubuntu}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1672-onedrive-for-ubuntu}

If you want to synchronize or download files in OneDrive to DSC desktops running Ubuntu, you can follow the following guidelines on Ubuntu client computers.

\textbf{NOTE:} If you have a large OneDrive quota, you are strongly encourage to synchronize ONLY the folder / directory you need. Fail to do so may result in your DSC account reach its storage quota. That will freeze your account!

To setup link to your cloud storage in OneDrive, run the following command and follow instructions on the screen:
\begin{verbatim}
onedrive --monitor
\end{verbatim}
Press Ctrl + C if you don't want to synchromize everything in the Cloud space.
A sample run is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
onedrive --monitor
Configuring Global Azure AD Endpoints
Authorize this app visiting:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=...

Initializing the Synchronization Engine ...
Initializing monitor ...
OneDrive monitor interval (seconds): 300
Creating local directory: ...
......
\end{verbatim}

To synchronize only one folder "dsc\_files" from the Cloud / OneDrive
\begin{verbatim}
onedrive --synchronize --single-directory 'dsc_files'
\end{verbatim}
To download files / folders only:
\begin{verbatim}
onedrive --synchronize --single-directory 'dsc_files' --download-only
\end{verbatim}
To upload to OneDrive without deleting files in cloud that are missing from local directories
\begin{verbatim}
onedrive --synchronize --upload-only --no-remote-delete
\end{verbatim}
To show OneDrive setting:
\begin{verbatim}
onedrive --display-config

\section{Logging in to SC systems}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/174-logging-in-to-sc-systems}

Computing resources can be accessed both through the SSH gateway servers (\texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu}) and through the FSU VPN (\texttt{vpn.fsu.edu}).

\subsection*{SSH connection to pamd.sc.fsu.edu}
Accessing the SSH gateway server is simple. Use your workstation's SSH client to directly log in to \texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu}. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
% ssh pamd.sc.fsu.edu
\end{verbatim}
You will be prompted for a username and password. If the login information you entered is correct, you will have access to a shell on \texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu}. From this shell on \texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu}, users can access public computing resources by running command "hallway" or "classroom".

\textbf{Never} use the \texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu} servers to run processor intensive jobs.

\section{Storage, Backup and Recovery}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/175-storage-backup-and-recovery}

Only DSC accounts with valid FSU accounts are backed up - temporary accounts, eg: \texttt{wkshop01}, are not backed up.
SC provides centralized file storage via \href{http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/zfs.jsp}{ZFS} file system. The system provides a RAID-based storage to ensure against the loss of two disk drives.

Share file system provides home directories and research space for all desktops and pamd.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users have a fixed disk quota (see below) on their home directory, which is based on our current backup capacity. As our backup capacity increases, so will user quotas on home directories. Disk quotas are not increased otherwise.
    \item Users have other options if more disk space is needed than is available in their home directory.
    \item Request a research partition by sending a message to \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu}. A research partition with a maximum capacity of 900 GB will be given to SC faculty members upon request.
    \item Research partitions are not backed up.
    \item Inactive research partitions will be reclaimed following confirmation from the faculty member.
    \item Files on individual desktop systems are not backed up.
    \item Files over 500 MB are not backed up.
    \item Users wishing to protect local files can save these files to the shared file system by mounting their user volume locally (via Samba, sshfs, scp, rsync or other mechanisms) and copying the important files to this directory.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Recovery}
To recover lost files from the last three weeks, please send a request to \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu} stating the date and files or directories to be restored.
No archival data beyond 21 days is maintained.

\subsection*{Backup Technology}
The backup system consists of a 10 TB iSCSI configured in Raid 5 with a hot spare with a \href{http://www.dell.com/us/en/k-12/servers/pedge_1950/pd.aspx?refid=pedge_1950&cs=22&s=k12}{Dell 1950} acting as the hosting node. Backups are accomplished with \href{http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/}{rsync}.

\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/176-web-pages}

\subsection*{Creating New FAQs}
The FAQ section is reserved for Administrative frequently asked questions. New FAQ entries must contain the following HTML code as its template:
\begin{verbatim}
<p><strong>Q:</strong> ?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> </p>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Populating Metadata Information}
Every article under Joomla can have metadata associated with it. This metadata is used to display Related Articles below the current article. It is important to \textbf{NOT} use generic keywords in the metadata. This will result in unrelated articles being displayed instead of only the relevant ones. To circumvent this problem, only use keywords which are unique to the article you are working on. Refrain from using commonly used words (\textit{the, and, who, what, when, etc.}).
\href{http://www.sc.fsu.edu/images/stories/techdocs/joomla/metadata.png}{Click here to see an example}.

\subsection*{Adding the Lightbox Effect}
To add a lightbox effect to images the following class tag must be added.
\paragraph{Example Code}
\begin{verbatim}
<a class="modal" href="/images/joomla_logo_black.jpg">
<img src="/images/joomla_logo_black.jpg" 
width="100" height="26" /></a>
\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Working Example}
\href{/images/joomla_logo_black.jpg}{Joomla Logo}

\subsection*{Adding Slider Panes}
To add slider panes to web pages the following code template should be used. An example of this feature is used in this current page.
\begin{verbatim}
{slider=Heading 1}
content for heading 1
{slider=Heading 2}
content for heading 2
{/sliders}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Showing Code in Articles}
To show code in articles you must use the \texttt{"pre xml:html"} tags. This activates the Code Hightlighter (GeSHi) which nicely displays your code with syntax highlighting. Replace the starting and ending quotes in the below example with less than and greater than characters, respectively.
\begin{verbatim}
<pre xml:html>
  ...

\section{Printing}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/179-printing}

To use the department's printers you must be connected to the local network. This mean that if you are working off campus or using the campus wireless network you must first connect to the department's VPN (see VpnSetup for more details). Assume you have network access and permission to the printers, you may \href{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/206-network-printer-setup}{set them up as described here}.

Note: The department \href{http://printers.sc.fsu.edu/printers/}{print server} uses the "CUPS" software. Consolidation of printing services will change this.

\subsection*{Poster Printing}
Posters are only printed for Department of Scientific Computing faculty and students.
Requests to print posters must be made/endorsed by an SC faculty member and are approved by the SC Director.

\subsection*{Printer etiquette}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When you submit a job to a printer, please retrieve your output as soon as possible. Output which is left in the copy room over 24 hours will be thrown away.
    \item When you do pick up your output, and it is located within a large stack of pages, please do so carefully so as to not disturb the output of other users. Don't pull out pages while the printer is printer and then try to put them back. This leads to "shuffling" the pages and leads to a lot of confusion. Please dispose of unnecessary pages in the recycling boxes located on the floor beneath the counters, and in the trays designated for this purpose nearby all of the printers.
    \item Please respect the resourses. Do NOT try to clear jams, or correct problems with the printers, even if on weekends. Our printers are not covered under warranty, and repairs are very expensive. Send email to sysops or to Dana Lutton.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Known Printer Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acrobat files may not print from Windows to the pr483 QMS 860 printer. This printer is a Level 2 PostScript and most current Acrobat files contain Level 3 PostScript commands in them.
    \item The pr473 HP printer is also a Level 2 PostScript printer and will not print Level 3 PostScript files. You will need to set your application to print Level 2 PostScript only.
    \item It is recommended that you not print manual paperfeed jobs from UNIX where the printer must pause and wait for the manual feed tray to be loaded.
    \item Level 3 PostScript commands primarily deal with the "color" definitions and commands, and are the primary cause of printing problems on Level 2 PostScript printers.
    \item Problems printing PhotoShop files. Some Adobe PhotoShop files contain binary information prior to the \%!PS, and following the \%EOF. To properly print these files you must remove the binary information from the begin and the end of the file. This especially applies to people who must incorporate them into (La)TeX documents using dvips.
    \item All PostScript files must contain \%!PS as the first 4 characters. If your file doesn't print, this is a likely cause.
    \item PostScript files received by email may contain aberrant characters, at the end of line, or beginning of new lines. Binary portions of files received by email may be truncated, and will not print.
    \item Problems with lpr and EPS files. EPS files are "encapsulated" and contain no "printer specific" information. To print an EPS file using the lpr file.eps command you need to have a "utility wrapper" surrounding this code.
    \item Web pages and PDF files containing graphics are a whole "other" issue -- many of them cannot be printed because they were incorrectly made to begin with.
    \item If a PDF was made with special fonts that are not installed on a printer the file will not print correctly. Authors should be encouraged to embed all fonts into their pdf document to avoid this problem.

\section{vscode Proxy through SSH Tunnel}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1831-vscode}

If you want to use vscode to connect to \texttt{targetHost.sc.fsu.edu} from a computer at home through proxy \texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu}, please use the following steps.
Feel free to email \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu} if you have any difficulty.

\subsection*{Configure SSH for ProxyJump}
You'll want to add a configuration for \texttt{targetHost.sc.fsu.edu} in your SSH config file to use \texttt{pamd.sc.fsu.edu} as an intermediate (jump) host.
Open or create the SSH configuration file using whatever text editor you prefer, we use nano as an example:
\begin{verbatim}
nano ~/.ssh/config
\end{verbatim}
Add the following settings to the SSH configuration file \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/config}:
\begin{verbatim}
Host pamd
    HostName pamd.sc.fsu.edu
    User fsuid
Host targetHost
    HostName targetHost.sc.fsu.edu
    User fsuid
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<private_key_for_targetHost>
    ProxyJump pamd
\end{verbatim}
Make sure the \texttt{IdentityFile} points to the correct SSH private key for each host.

\subsection*{Set Up the SSH Extension in VS Code}
Install the \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh}{Remote - SSH} extension for VS Code if you haven't already:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to Extensions and search for "Remote - SSH."
    \item Install the extension.
    \item Open the Command Palette in VS Code and search for "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..."
    \item Type \texttt{targetHost.sc.fsu.edu} (or the alias name you set in \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/config} for targetHost) and select it.
\end{enumerate}
VS Code will automatically use the SSH config you defined, routing the connection through \texttt{pamd} to reach \texttt{targetHost}.

\subsection*{Verify Connection}
Once connected, VS Code should open a remote session on targetHost. You can confirm the connection by checking the VS Code terminal, which should indicate it's connected to targetHost. Now you can open files, run commands, and work as if you were directly connected to targetHost.

\section{Network Printer Setup}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/206-network-printer-setup}

If the information provided here is not enough, please contact \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu}.

\textbf{Note:} Due to the print quota scheme, print jobs will simply be dropped if your login name is not found in the LDAP directory. One solution is to use -U option of lpr command, for example, \texttt{lpr -U username file2Print.ps}. The best solution is to implement LDAP authentication or change the login name to SC uid.

\subsection*{Add a Network Printer for Windows 10/7}
To determine the make and model of the printer you wish to add, go to \url{http://printers.sc.fsu.edu/printers}.
For this example, we will use Ricoh MP 2555, mfp473
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to 'Printers and Faxes
    \item Click on 'Add a Printer'
    \item Click Next through the Add a Printer Wizard
    \item Click the button for 'A Network Printer....'
    \item In the 'Specify' a Printer box, click on the button for 'Connect to a printer on the internet'
    \item In the space provided, type: \url{http://printers.sc.fsu.edu:631/printers/mfp473}
    \item Click 'Next'
    \item Select your printer make and model from the list to install the correct print driver. See the end of the page for Windows drivers.
    \item Complete the Add a Printer Wizard
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{NOTE:} In this case, and a few others the exact driver is not listed in the Windows Driver Menu. Select the closest driver to your printer model as possible. For the 4300 Series use the 'HP Laser Jet 4100 series PS' driver. Additionally, the current version of the CUPS Printing Software support both PostScript and PCL Drivers.

\subsection*{Add a Network Printer for MAC OS X}
To determine the make and model of the printer you wish to add, go to: \url{http://printers.sc.fsu.edu/printers}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open System Preferences and click "Print \& Fax".
    \item Click Printing and then click the "+" sign to open the "Printer Browser" box.
    \item For "Protocol", select LPD
    \item For "Address" enter printers.sc.fsu.edu
    \item For "Queue" enter the printer name (EX. mfp420, mfp473, mfp150v)
    \item For "Printer Name" , type the name of the printer (Should be the same name as in "Queue")
    \item For "Location", you can fill in or leave blank.
    \item For "Print Using", Scroll through the list of printer manufacturers and select the maker of the printer.
    \item Next, Scroll through the list of printer models and select your model to install the correct print driver.
    \item Finally, click on "Add" to include the printer on your list of available printers.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{NOTE:} When the exact driver is not listed in the Driver Menu, select the closest driver to your printer model as possible. Additionally, the current version of the CUPS Printing Software only support PostScript printing.

\subsection*{Network Printers for UNIX}
In most cases, network printers are configured and ready to go as they are. If you need to setup them up for some reason, here are the steps.
DSC uses the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) to manage printing jobs. If you already have CUPS installed on your system, place the following into your \texttt{client.conf} file (usually \texttt{/etc/cups/client.conf})
\begin{verbatim}
ServerName printers.sc.fsu.edu
\end{verbatim}
Remember to restart cupsd after saving the changes to the file.
You can print to any printer through most of the application printer interface. To print or manage print jobs using command line:
\begin{verbatim}
lpr -P mfp420 filename
lpq -P mfp420
lprm -P mfp420 jobID
\end{verbatim}

\section{Thunderbird FAQ}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/233-thunderbird-faq}

Thunderbird works largely the same on all platforms: Linux, Windows and Macintosh. For users working on more than one platform, Thunderbird can be a significant benefit comparing with other email clients. The solutions given here may vary slightly in naming and layout depending on the platforms. If you need to setup Thunderbird, consult \href{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/178-email}{this page} first.

\subsection*{How to turn on/off email forwarding from fsu.edu?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Login \url{http://webmail.fsu.edu}
    \item From top menus, click Options/Mail/Settings
    \item Check/uncheck "Enable forwarding"
\end{enumerate}
Be careful not to create forwading loops with other email accounts!

\subsection*{How to display the size and number of messages in a folder?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to "Preferences / Advanced / General"
    \item Check "Show expanded colums in the folder pane"
    \item In the folder pane, click on the icon next to "Name" column and select Total and/or Size
    \item Likewise each message size can be displayed by clicking on the icon in the email pane
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{How to setup reply above/before the original message?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to "Account Settings... / Composition \& Addressing" of the mailbox in question
    \item Check "Automatically quote the original message when replying"
    \item Then, "Start my reply above the quote"
    \item and place my signature "below my reply (above the quote)" if preferred
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{How to setup FSU address book?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to "Preferences / Composition / Addressing"
    \item Check "Directory Server"
    \item Click on "Edit Directories..." and "Add" buttons
    \item Enter the fields as shown (Hostname: addressbook.fsu.edu) below and make sure to use your own "Bind DN: uid=fsuid,ou=people,dc=fsu,dc=edu".
    \item After saving the settings, go to "Offline" tab and click on "Download Now", which should help with adddres completion performance.
    \item Under the "Directory Server" drop-down menu, select the address book just created.
    \item Now you should be able to get automatic address completion for FSU email addresses.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{How to keep local copies of IMAP messages?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to "Account Settings... / Offline \& Disk Space" of the mailbox in question
    \item Check "When I create new folders, select them for offline use"
    \item Click on "Select folders for offline use..." button and check folders you want to keep local copies.
\end{enumerate}
This is helpful on laptops so you can still read old messages when network connections are not available. If you wonder where the messages are saved, go to "Accoutn Settings / Server Settings", "Local directory" should display the folder.

\subsection*{How to change the original message indicator from the colored bars to the traditional >?}
Go to "Account Settings... / Composition \& Addressing"
Uncheck "Compose messages in HTML format"
This is equivalent to "\texttt{mail.identity.default.compose\_html = false}"

\subsection*{How to setup calendar in Thunderbird?}
Download \href{https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/lightning/}{Lightning plugin} for Thunderbird, which also provide "Tasks" service
One main drawback of the Tasks is the inability to save tasks and to transport them. If you have Gmail account, you are encouraged to use \href{https://www.google.com/calendar}{Google Calendar} and its Tasks service instead.

Lightening plugin serves as a portal for various calendars you may have: FSU calendars, Google calendars and others. If you prefer a separate application altogether, use \href{http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html}{Sunbird}. It is better to use Lightning plugin to only view the various calendars since changing calendar events may require complicated authentications. Its reminders may not be working properly each time you reload the calendars. SyncCGP plugin may help where Lightning is lacking, but we will try to keep things simple for now.

Install Lightning as follows
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In Thunderbird, go to "Tools / Add-ons"
    \item Click "Install" button, and select the file you downloaded and click "OK". Restart Thunderbird.
    \item Under Calendar, go to "Calendar / New Calendar..."
    \item Select "On the network" and click "Next".
    \item For Google calendars, select "iCalendar" and enter in the "Location" with the private URL provided by Google unless your calendar is publicly available.
    \item For FSU calendars, select "Sun Java System Calendar Server (WCAP)" with "Location: \url{https://webmail.fsu.edu:83}" as shown below.
\end{enumerate}
FSU calendars can be configured via \url{http://webmail.fsu.edu}. Refers to \href{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/243-fsu-calendar}{this}.

\section{Outlook FAQ}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/234-outlook-faq}

Make sure you turn off forwarding from fsu.edu to scs.fsu.edu and turn on forwarding from scs.fsu.edu to fsu.edu. The former is to prevent forward loops, the latter is to prevent duplicates when moving and synchronizing the two mailboxes or folders. Here is a brief summary of these two steps.

\subsection*{Turn off forwarding from fsu.edu}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Login \url{http://webmail.fsu.edu}
    \item From top menus, click Options/Mail/Settings
    \item Uncheck "Enable forwarding" or at least remove \texttt{fsuid@scs.fsu.edu} and other CSIT and SCRI accounts from "Mail Forwarding list:" if any
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Turn on forwarding from scs.fsu.edu}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Login \url{http://mail.scs.fsu.edu}

\section{Hosting Policy}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/287-hosting-policy}

\subsection*{Support for non-DSC HPC systems}
The DSC plays a major rule in the support of FSU's computational infrastructure by providing expert technical support in advanced computing. In addition to the management of FSU's shared multidisciplinary HPC (see \url{http://hpc.fsu.edu}), the DSC has also invested a large sum of funds to develop a computing facility located in the center of the main FSU campus. This facility is currently equipped with 1000 square feet of raised floor, battery backup power, high-speed network connectivity to the campus network backbone and the Florida Lambda Rail, and 80 tons of cooling.

As part of it's service to University, the DSC hosts computational servers owned by other FSU academic units on a first-come, first-served basis until 25\% of the DSC machine room cooling, electrical, or floor capacity is reached. Once the capacity of the room is reached, the DSC will not support additional machines.

\subsection*{Eligibility}
All units within the College of Arts and Sciences are eligible to have machines hosted in the DSC computer room. The DSC's Local Systems Committee will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis and will agree to host machines provided the capacity allocated for non-DSC systems has not been reached and the requirements listed below are met.

\subsection*{Requirements}
Each of the requirements enumerated below is described in greater detail in the following pages.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The DSC is not responsible for incidental costs associated with the installation or maintenance of computer systems hosted in the DSC computer room.
    \item Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a detailed hardware proposal.
    \item Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a proposal describing how the computer systems will be managed.
    \item Computer systems hosted in DSC computer room are required to run the DSC load distribution system.
    \item Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a designated faculty liaison from within the unit making the request.
\end{enumerate}
For questions or information regarding availability contact Jim Wilgenbusch at 645-0307 or \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu}.

\subsubsection*{1. Incidental costs}
In addition to the substantial costs of providing a cold room with reliable power, there are a number of "incidental" costs associated with hosting computer systems. These costs include server racks, power distribution units (PDUs or power strips), and network switches. The DSC is not responsible for covering incidental costs. At a minimum, the DSC will provide a single outlet for each electrical circuit required to power the computer system and a single 10/100/1000 network uplink in the vicinity of the computer system. The cost of incidentals (e.g., racks, PDUs, and network connectivity) can either be included in the price of a fully integrated system or the DSC will provide these items at cost. In order to avoid half empty racks, the later option may be required. For example, if a group plans to purchase a small number of servers, then the DSC would prefer to use an existing rack, PDU, and network switch. In this case, costs will be assessed according to the portion of the resource being used.

\subsubsection*{2. Hardware proposal}
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a detailed hardware proposal. An agreement to house a computer system in the DSC computer room is limited to the hardware described in the proposal. This requirement is intended to safeguard against someone purchasing hardware that is in some way incompatible with the DSC machine room infrastructure. In addition, the hardware proposal is needed to estimate the power, space, and cooling requirements of the computer system so that we do not exceed the capacity of the DSC computer room. The DSC has a wealth of experience with numerous hardware vendors and can create the hardware proposal on the behalf of unit making the request.

Hardware proposals must include the following information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Server rack dimensions *
    \item Switch type and size *
    \item PDU type and quantity *
    \item Chassis type per unit
    \item CPU type and quantity per unit
    \item Motherboard type per unit
    \item Ethernet or network adapter type and quantity per unit
    \item Hard drive type and quantity per unit
    \item Memory type and quantity per unit
    \item Type and quantity of all peripheral devises that will be part of the computer system (e.g. disk arrays, CD/DVD drives, etc.)
\end{itemize}
* if not using equipment provided by the DSC

\subsubsection*{3. Management proposal}
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a proposal describing how the computer system will be managed. Two general administrative options are available; 1. the DSC will manage the computer system, and 2. the unit making the request will manage the computer system.

\paragraph{Option 1: DSC manages the computer system}
Option 1 gives a group access to a computational resource without the hassle of having to administer it. The DSC will agree to manage a computer system only if the DSC is given discretion to choose the hardware, the operating system, and the tools used to update and distribute software on the computer system. The DSC systems manager determines who is granted access to privileged commands. Access to privileged commands will be controlled by the "sudo" command; root logins are not permitted. Only members of the DSC systems group will know the root password. The DSC systems manager will determine the update cycle of the core operating system and system software.

\paragraph{Option 2: Non-DSC unit manages the computer system}
If a unit chooses to manage their own computer system, then a qualified systems administrator must be designated to manage the resource. The required management proposal must address in detail how the designated systems administrator will tend the following tasks: account management, disk management, network management, system installation, software management, security, systems management, user support, hardware support, and administration of purchase and warranty information. Systems not managed by the DSC will be relegated to a separate secure network. A firewall will monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic and the DSC systems manager will determine the stringency of the firewall. Access the machine room will be limited to the designated systems administrator. Members of the DSC systems group will have root access to all systems housed in the DSC computer room.

\subsubsection*{4. Cycle sharing}
In order to maximize throughput on DSC and non-DSC computational servers and cluster nodes, the DSC uses a job scheduling and queuing system called Condor (\url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/}). All of the computer systems housed in the DSC computer room must participate in this system. The Condor system allows fine-grain configuration of policies to support distributively owned computing resources. For example, specific nodes can be configured to "prefer" jobs submitted by specific users. This way, a resource owner will have limited access to all of the DSC computational resources and guaranteed access to his or her machines. This system ensures that cycles are not wasted if the primary resource owner is not using them.

While the Condor system provides some important advantages to managing and distributing computationally intensive jobs, a resource owner is not obligated to use it. For example, a resource owner can run jobs interactively on any of his or her computer systems and his or her jobs will preempt jobs managed by the Condor system. Circumventing the Condor system in this way is to the disadvantage of the resource owner, however. By submitting jobs through the Condor system, a resource owner will not only have guaranteed access to his or her machines, but the Condor system will also provide access to the other machines housed in the DSC machine room.

\subsubsection*{5. Faculty Liaison}
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a designated faculty liaison from within the unit making the request. The liaison will be responsible for conveying information to the users of the computer system housed in the DSC computer room. If the DSC agrees to manage a computer system, the faculty liaison is responsible for approving account requests, requesting changes to a user's priority, and requesting software installations. The authority to make these requests can be transferred to a designate person (e.g., graduate student) at the written request of the faculty liaison.

Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven interactive data and function plotting utility for UNIX, IBM OS/2, MS Windows, DOS, Macintosh, VMS, Atari and many other platforms. The software is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally intended as to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data. It does this job pretty well, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses, including web scripting and integration as a plotting engine for third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under development since 1986. For more information see the \href{http://www.gnuplot.info/}{Gnuplot homepage}.

\section{MATLAB}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/325-matlab}

MATLAB, the MATrix LABratory, is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numeric computation. Using MATLAB, you can solve technical computing problems faster than with traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran. For more see: \href{https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html}{MathWorks MATLAB website} and \href{https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/the-origins-of-matlab.html}{Origins of MATLAB}.

The primary benefits of developing a project with MATLAB include: efficient, concise array manipulations; availability of many already-implemented numerical routines (via the standard distribution, add-on toolboxes, or online software repositories); and the large community of users available for support. One particularly active MATLAB community and software repository is MATLAB Central. For more see: \href{https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/}{MATLAB Central}.

\subsection*{Toolboxes}
Toolboxes are add-ons to the standard MATLAB distribution. They provide additional functionality within a targeted application area. DSC has the following toolboxes available (current as of Spring 2009):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Control System Toolbox
    \item Fixed-Point Toolbox
    \item Image Processing Toolbox
    \item Mapping Toolbox
    \item Neural Network Toolbox
    \item Optimization Toolbox
    \item Partial Differential Equation Toolbox
    \item Signal Processing Toolbox
    \item Statistics Toolbox
    \item System Identification Toolbox
    \item Wavelet Toolbox
\end{itemize}
For more see: \href{https://www.mathworks.com/products.html}{MathWorks Product Listing}.

\subsection*{High-Performance Computing with MATLAB}
Beginning with MATLAB R2007b, new features have been implemented in the official MathWorks MATLAB distribution that allow for parallel and distributed computing. The MATLAB Distributed Computing Engine, used in conjunction with Distributed Computing Toolbox, enables MATLAB and Simulink users to execute applications on a computer cluster. For more see: \href{https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/parallel-matlab-multiple-processors-and-multiple-cores.html}{Cleve's Corner: Parallel MATLAB: Multiple Processors and Multiple Cores}.

MatlabMPI is set of MATLAB scripts that implement a subset of MPI and allow any MATLAB program to be run on a parallel computer. The key innovation of MatlabMPI is that it implements the widely used MPI look and feel on top of standard MATLAB file i/o, resulting in a pure MATLAB implementation that is exceedingly small (\textasciitilde{}300 lines of code). Thus, MatlabMPI will run on any combination of computers that MATLAB supports. For more see: \href{http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/isr/matlabmpi.html}{MATLAB MPI}.

\subsection*{Running MATLAB}
With the exception of the classroom and hallway computers, MATLAB access is available only on the \href{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/systems/general-purpose-cluster.php}{General Purpose (GP) Cluster through SGE}. Unless initiated through an X11-capable terminal (i.e. Gnome Terminal, xterm, rxvt, etc.), MATLAB will start in a text-only command-line mode.
\textbf{NOTE:} To force MATLAB to run in command-line mode use the following flags: \texttt{matlab -nodesktop -nojvm -nosplash}
\begin{description}
    \item[-nodesktop] Start MATLAB without its desktop.
    \item[-nojvm] Start MATLAB without the Java virtual machine (JVM).
    \item[-nosplash] Start MATLAB but does not display the splash screen.
\end{description}
\subsubsection*{DSC General Access}
MATLAB must be run remotely using SGE
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open an X11 terminal and type: \texttt{qlogin}
    \item SGE will locate the least-loaded classroom node and initiate a connection.
    \item After authenticating, type: \texttt{matlab}
\end{enumerate}
If \texttt{qlogin} is not available on your machine, you must run the above commands from the PAMD cluster.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item SSH to pamd: \texttt{ssh -X pamd.sc.fsu.edu}
    \item Then follow the above instructions.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Classroom and Hallway Computers}
MATLAB is installed locally on each machine.
Open an X11 terminal and type: \texttt{matlab}
\subsubsection*{In Batch Mode}
There are circumstances where a user would want to run MATLAB without its graphical user interface (GUI). For example, a user may want call a MATLAB script from a Makefile, or submit multiple batch jobs to a queuing system.
\paragraph{From a Makefile}
Use the following syntax:
\texttt{cd WORKING\_DIRECTORY \&\& matlab -nosplash -nojvm -r PATH\_TO\_MATLAB\_SCRIPT}
where \texttt{WORKING\_DIRECTORY} is the directory that MATLAB will work in.
\texttt{PATH\_TO\_MATLAB\_SCRIPT} is the path to the MATLAB m-file you wish to run

\subsection*{Learning MATLAB}
There are a plethora of beginning MATLAB tutorials on the internet. A few are listed here:
\begin{itemize}

\section{R}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/326-r}

R is a language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics. It is a \href{http://www.gnu.org/}{GNU} project
which is similar to the S language and environment which
was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT\&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as
a different implementation of S. There are some important differences,
but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is
highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for
research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source
route to participation in that activity.

One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed
publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the
defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user
retains full control.

R is available as Free Software under the terms of the \href{http://www.fsf.org/}{Free Software Foundation}'s
GNU General Public License in source code
form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and
similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

\section{g++}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/335-g}

The command \texttt{g++} invokes the C++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \texttt{.C}, \texttt{.cc}, \texttt{.cpp}, \texttt{.c++}, \texttt{.cp}, or \texttt{.cxx}; preprocessed C++ files use the suffix \texttt{.ii}. GCC recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++ even when invoked as \texttt{gcc}. However, C++ programs often require additional class libraries, and under some circumstances you might want to compile programs from standard input, or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs. \texttt{g++} is a program that calls GCC with the default language set to C++, and automatically specifies linking against the C++ library.

When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs. These options may be found in the \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/}{GCC documentation} or on the \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/}{GCC web site}.

machines. The library is written in C and is callable from either C or
Fortran. The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with
partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering for
sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative backward
error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.

\section{Using SSH}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/345-using-ssh}

\subsection*{Passwordless authentication}
\textbf{Note:} Passwordless authentication has been disabled on the \texttt{pamd} servers. However, once inside our network you can setup passwordless ssh to other hosts normally.

Below you'll find the "barebones" steps needed to connect to a remote machine without having to enter your password. This is NOT a comprehensive explanation of how ssh or passwordless authentication works, rather it is simply some notes that I've kept to get ssh to work for my purposes. You should also know that setting up passwordless authentication for your account and machine will expose you to at least one security vulnerability. For example, if someone logged into your account on your machine then they can access any other machine that has been configured to accept passwordless authentication. That said, here's how to do it.

There are two versions of ssh and each version has a slightly
different way of authenticating. I'll break things down into multiple
parts to cover all of the ways you could connect to the different
clients. To find out what version off ssh you are using type:
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -V
\end{verbatim}
You'll either get something that has the string OpenSSH in it or something like this, \texttt{SSH Secure Shell 3.1.0 non-commercial version}. I'll refer to the former as OpenSSH and to the later as ssh.com

\subsubsection*{OpenSSH to OpenSSH}
Most SCS systems are configured to use OpenSSH, which will make your life considerably more simple. The most notable exception to this is the IBM SP machines. The IBMs use the ssh.com version of ssh. It is still possible to connect to machines using differenct implementations of SSH, but it adds an extra layer of work that I will talk about later. In this section I'll discuss how to setup passwordless authentication between a host and a server running openSSH.

First, you need to create a public key using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
ssh-keygen -t dsa
\end{verbatim}
You'll be prompted for a passphrase and you might be prompted to name the identity files. Leave them blank and hit return.
\begin{verbatim}
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_dsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
af:02:20:6e:05:96:84:5a:cc:2c:0a:1e:db:bb:1c:8b
\end{verbatim}
In this step, two files were generated; one is the local identity file (\texttt{id\_dsa}) and the other is the public key that will go into a specific file on the remote host. If the remote host mounts your SC home directory then this step is simple. Change directories to thehidden ssh configuration directory:
\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/.ssh
\end{verbatim}
Copy the contents of \texttt{id\_dsa.pub} into the \texttt{authorized\_keys2} file.
\begin{verbatim}
cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2
\end{verbatim}
Notice that I've used the append redirect (\texttt{>>}) because you can have multiple host identity keys in the same \texttt{authorized\_keys2} file. The important thing here is that each key must occupy its own line. If you don't yet have an \texttt{authorized\_keys2} file then you can do something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
cat id_dsa.pub > authorized_keys2
\end{verbatim}
That's it. You should now be able to logon to a remote host that is mounting your SCS home directory without having to type in your password. If you are attempting to connect to a remote server that doesn't mount the the CSIT user file system then you will need to copy the public key to the sever and paste or redirect the file into the authorized\_keys2 file. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
scp ./id_dsa.pub faroffserver.bingo.org:.ssh/.
ssh remoteHost.bingo.org
remoteHost> cd .ssh
remoteHost> cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2
\end{verbatim}
note! if the file doesn't exist you'll need to do this:
\begin{verbatim}
remoteHost> cat id_dsa.pub > authorized_keys2
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{OpenSSH to ssh.com}
Now you want to connect to a remote server using the ssh.com implementation of ssh from a host that's using OpenSSH. This would be the case if you wanted to connect to one of SCS's IBM machines from most of the other SCS machines. Start by generating an ssh.com (SECSH) formatted public key from the OpenSSH public key already in your \texttt{.ssh} directory and put the new key in the right place. Here's what you'll do:
\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -e -f id_dsa.pub > id_dsa_secsh.pub
\end{verbatim}
SSH.com stores it's configuration files in a hidden directory called \texttt{.ssh2}. If you are trying to connect to a remote machine that mounts the SCS user file system then you'll need to create the \texttt{.ssh2} directory if doesn't already exist.
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir ~/.ssh2
cd ~/.ssh2
\end{verbatim}
Next you will need to copy the new file to the \texttt{.ssh2} directory and configure the authorization file so that it knows where to look to find the key.
\begin{verbatim}
cp ~/.ssh/id_dsa_secsh.pub ~/.ssh2/.
echo Key id_dsa_secsh.pub >> authorization
\end{verbatim}
Again, if the authorization file doesn't exist then you'll need to do:
\begin{verbatim}
echo Key id_dsa_secsh.pub > authorization
\end{verbatim}
That's it. If the remote server to which you are trying to connect does not mount the DSC file system then you will copy the key file to the remote machine and then logon to the machine and make the changes described above.

\subsubsection*{SSH.com to OpenSSH}
Much of what is needed in the section is covered more verbosely
above so I'm going to stick to the commands needed to configure a local
host running ssh.com (local) to connect to a remote host running
OpenSSH (remote).
\begin{verbatim}
local> ssh-keygen -t dsa

\section{Printing FAQ}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/352-printerfaq}

DSC has consolidated all of its printing and copying options under one contract with three Konica Minolta multifunction printers. As part of this contract, the department is now charged 6 cents per color page, 1 cent per grayscale page. For this reason we have implemented a print accounting systems based on Pykota on top of CUPS. If you have any problems with printing please consult the FAQ below. If you do not find your answer here please contact TSG with your job number and a description of the issue.

\begin{description}
    \item[Q:] What is my quota?
    \item[A:] The default quotas were determined by the department to be \$30 per semester (6months) for faculty and \$10 per semester (6 months) for students. Color pages cost 6 cents per page, grayscale 1 cent per page.
    
    \item[Q:] How do I find out the current balance of my quota?
    \item[A:] We have made an interface for you to review the quota and print jobs that can be found from the print quota link on the main page (note you must be logged in to see this).
    
    \item[Q:] Why don't I have a quota set?
    \item[A:] If you have no quota set this means you aren't listed as being part of the department, if this is a mistake please contact \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu} and we will correct it.
    
    \item[Q:] Can I still print if I have no quota or I have used it all up?
    \item[A:] Yes you should still be able to print if you add more credit to the account.
    
    \item[Q:] How do I increase my quota if I need it?
    \item[A:] You can contact Michele Locke and arrange for additional money to be placed on your account that will allow you to print additional pages.
    
    \item[Q:] I am printing from my personal laptop, why do none of my jobs get printed?
    \item[A:] When printing from your personal computer it is important to make sure that the username of your own machine matches your SC/FSU username. Each print job needs to correspond to a user for accountability. If printing with command \texttt{lpr}, this can be done with the -U flag. It is also important to put your personal computer on the proper network via VPN or otherwise.
    
    \item[Q:] My print job seems to sit around in the queue for a long time. Why?
    \item[A:] There can be a lot of reasons. The most important of which is that these are multifunction printers, if someone is copying or scanning with them, they will be unavailable for printing. Check and see if the printer is busy. Also only one print job can be sent to the printer at a time, this means that if someone else prints a job to a queue that is set for the same printer, one job will have to wait for the other to complete first. Email \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu} if attention is needed.

\section{MPI}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/361-mpi}

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a specification for an API that allows many computers to communicate with one another. The MPI standard includes point-to-point message-passing, collective communications, group and communicator concepts, process topologies, environmental management, process creation and management, one-sided communications, extended collective operations, external interfaces, I/O, some miscellaneous topics, and a profiling interface. Language bindings for C, C++ and Fortran are defined. OpenMPI and MPICH2 are two popular free MPI implementations.

\textbf{Note:} At DSC, we currently support OpenMPI and MPICH2 on owner-based clusters only.

\subsection*{OpenMPI}
The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI is a project combining technologies and resources from several other projects (LAM/MPI, FT-MPI, LA-MPI, and PACX-MPI) in order to build the best MPI library available. OpenMPI programs must be compiled and linked with the appropriate MPI compiler. The user creates a special environment for jobs to run in.

\subsection*{MPICH2}
MPICH2 is a freely available, portable implementation of MPI, the Standard for message-passing libraries. It implements both MPI-1 and MPI-2. MPICH2 is supposed to be a compatible replacement for any MPICH version 1 implementation. MPICH2 requires users to build and link against the set of provided routines then run in a special environment. See the \href{https://www.mpich.org/documentation/guides/}{MPICH2 documentation} for additional specifications.

\end{itemize}

\section{Owner-Based FAQs}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/383-owner-based-faqs}

\subsection*{How do I get an account on a cluster?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If you already have an DSC account, access can be requested through \href{https://sc.fsu.edu/members/profile}{SCUM}.
    \item These requests will be sent to the cluster owner for approval.
    \item If you do not already have an DSC account, you must first request a DSC sponsored account.
    \item To request a DSC sponsored account, go to \href{https://sc.fsu.edu/members/profile}{SCUM}, click on "Request a DSC Account", select "Sponsored Account", then select the DSC faculty member that will act as your account sponsor.
    \item Once the account sponsor approves your request, you can request cluster access.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How do I log into the cluster?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cluster resources (compute nodes, etc.) can only be accessed through the cluster headnode.
    \item Inside the DSC network, cluster headnodes can be accessed using \texttt{ssh}.
    \item For example, to log into a cluster called \texttt{phoenix}, type: \texttt{ssh phoenix}
    \item If you are outside the DSC network, you must first log into PAMD to get past our firewall:
    \begin{verbatim}
ssh pamd.sc.fsu.edu
ssh phoenix
    \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How do I compile programs?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the cluster headnode to compile programs intended to run on that cluster.
    \item On the headnode, your default path will be set to allow access to all compilers available on that system.
    \item For certain proprietary compilers, licensing issues will limit the number of simultaneous compilations allowed.
    \item If a compilation job fails because there are no available licenses, be patient and wait for other users' compilation processes to complete, then attempt your compilation again.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How do I run programs?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The headnode must be available to provide essential services to other cluster nodes, so it is imperitive that resource-intensive programs are never run directly on the headnode.
    \item Instead, all programs should be submitted via the cluster's queuing system.
    \item Although \texttt{ssh} may be allowed to compute nodes, please refrain from using this ability to run jobs, because this prevents the scheduler from optimally managing the cluster's resources.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How do I log into a specific node?}
In the event that it is necessary to direcly access a specific cluster node interactively, please use the cluster's queuing system.
\begin{verbatim}
qlogin -q [queue-name]
\end{verbatim}
you will be given a login on a node of that type.
If you need to log into a specific node you can use the form
\begin{verbatim}
qlogin -q [queue-name]@[machine-name]
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{What are the differences between the MPI implementations?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In general, most MPI implementations provide the same functionality, but in slightly different ways.
    \item OpenMPI provides many utilities that make it more portable and dynamic than the others, making it the suggested platform for new software development.
    \item Occasionally programs require features that are specific to another MPI implementation.
    \item Other MPI implementations are available on certain clusters, but often are often less scheduler-friendly, and have been known to leave processes running if a job dies unexpectedly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Macintosh System Configurations}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/433-macintosh-setup}

Topics cover the basic system configurations for SC Macintosh clients running Leopard (OS X 10.5.x). Configurations for Tiger may vary somewhat. They allow users without local accounts to access the computer via LDAP. User files can also be saved on the network in a transparent manner. This is ideal for public Macintosh systems. Individual Macs can be configured as such with a slight twist: Mobile accounts. It provides the consistency and convenience of tapping into department resources and yet allows the freedom to logon when off campus.

\subsection*{Configure the System to Use LDAP Authentication}
It may be necessary to reboot when LDAP settings have changed.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start /Applications/Utilities/Directory Utility or /System/Library/CoreServices/Directory, unlock and show advanced settings if needed. You need administrator access to make any changes.
    \item Under "Services" tab, edit LDAPv3
    \item Click on "New..." button
    \item Server Name or IP Address: \texttt{ldap-vm0.sc.fsu.edu}. Make sure "Encrypt using SSL" is unchecked, otherwise authentication will fail. As of this writing, this is a bug in Leopard. We can correct this setting later.
    \item Continue and choose template: RFC 2307 (Unix) and enter searchbase: \texttt{ou=people,dc=sc,dc=fsu,dc=edu}
    \item Save is as "LDAP" under "Configuration Name", click on "OK" to finish
    \item Earlier than Leopard, secure LDAP connection is not mandated. Modify the mandate by editing \texttt{/etc/openldap/ldap.conf}
    \texttt{TLS\_REQCERT demand ==> TLS\_REQCERT allow}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Configure the System to Use LDAP SSL to Authenticate}
Assume LDAP authentication is configured already and you need administrator privilege
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Directory Utility
    \item Services
    \item LDAPv3
    \item Encrypt using SSL
    \item Append the following to file \texttt{/usr/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt}
    \begin{verbatim}
Go Daddy Class 2 CA
===================
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
... (certificate data) ...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Append the following line
    \texttt{TLS\_CACERT /usr/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt}
    to file \texttt{/etc/openldap/ldap.conf} and make sure to restore allow to demand (default for Leopard)
    \texttt{TLS\_REQCERT allow ==> TLS\_REQCERT demand}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Automount Configuration for Remote Homedirectory}
Start "Directory Utility" as before, select "Mounts" tab
\begin{description}
    \item[Remote NFS URL:] nfs://pan-nfs.sc.fsu.edu/
    \item[Mount location:] /panfs/panasas1
\end{description}
\textbf{NOTE:} The trailing slash in the URL is critical. The absence of trailing slash in the mount location is also important.

\subsection*{Configure System to Use CUPS Printers}
If users prefer more options and better control with printers, refer to \href{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/206-network-printer-setup}{network printer setup} and install them with native drivers. Using CUPS printers, the administrative overhead is minimal.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Login as administrator and create or edit \texttt{/etc/cups/client.conf}
    \texttt{ServerName cups.sc.fsu.edu}
    \item Now users should have direct access to all CUPS printers (reboot if necessasry). All jobs will be printed as black and white by default unlike in most other cases where color is the default.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{How to print in color via CUPS printers?}
Select "Color Matching" under Options and then "In Printer"

\section{Windows X11}
\url{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/532-windows-x11}

To access Linux X11 resources - Matlab, Mathematica, Tecplot, Avizo, and COMSOL - from Windows computers, users need to have \href{http://www.sc.fsu.edu/software/win-ssh-client.php}{SSH Secure Shell Client} and X-Win32 properly configured. Users will also need \href{https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/204-vpn-access}{VPN client} if connecting from off campus.

\subsection*{How to turn on X11 tunneling from SSH Secure Shell Client?}
Start "SSH Secure Shell Client", go to "Profiles/Edit Profiles".
Select the profiles in question and/or Quick Connect, under "Tunneling" tab, check "Tunnel X11 connections".
If you start X-Win32 before "SSH Secure Shell Client", all X11 applications will tunnel through X-Win32. Make sure you allow that through the firewalls.

\subsection*{How to enable X-Win32 license (for all users of the computer)?}
Ask your system administrator or email \href{mailto:sysops@sc.fsu.edu}{sysops@sc.fsu.edu} for help.
After entering the correct license as username, copy file
\texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Documents and Settings\textbackslash{}username\textbackslash{}Application Data\textbackslash{}StarNet\textbackslash{}X-Win32\textbackslash{}License.config}
to folder
\texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Program Files\textbackslash{}StarNet\textbackslash{}X-Win32 9.4}.
That will enable all users of the computer to share that license.
