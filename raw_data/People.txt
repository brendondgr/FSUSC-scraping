Scientific Computing
I am interested in computational material science. Two main research topics in my group are: (1) developing new multiphysics methods to achieve high accuracy in materials simulations (such as predicting novel electronic structures at oxide interfaces) and (2) developing new orbital-free density functional theory to enable large-scale, accurate simulations of functional materials (such as metal alloys and lithium battery materials).

Research Interests:
Data Science
Artificial Intelligence
I have been engaged in the development of artificial intelligence since 2014, beginning with the advent of word2vec. Over the years, my research has evolved alongside the field, encompassing work on autoencoders, pruning techniques, graph neural networks, and topic modeling, eventually leading to modern transformer-based architectures. More recently, my focus has shifted toward the application of large language models (LLMs) in education, where I am developing tools to enhance classroom engagement and learning outcomes using frontier AI capabilities. I am also exploring the integration of agentic systems to streamline operations within the Department of Scientific Computing, with the dual goals of reducing administrative workload and improving visibility to prospective students.

Research Interests:
Data Assimilation
Artificial Intelligence

Atmospheric Dynamics
My research encompasses theoretical, computational and applied aspects of data assimilation — the science of optimally combining numerical models and observations of physical systems. In the past, I have utilized data assimilation algorithms to improve the representation of atmospheric convection through the incorporation of ground-based remote sensors. More recently, my focus has shifted to the development of new data assimilation methods which capitalize on the ongoing AI revolution. Beyond data assimilation, my interests also extend to numerical weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, and various topics within the data sciences.

I started out my science career as a practical evolutionary biologist working with frogs on islands in the mediterranean sea. There was no good analysis software for my data available at that time. Therefore, in 1994, I started a career as a computational biologist developing software (MIGRATE: https://popgen.sc.fsu.edu) for other biologists to analyze large-scale DNA datasets and compare different evolutionary hypotheses. My interests have centered on the coalescent and how we can use that to infer parameters of population genetic models and also compare them statistically.

Personal Homepage
Research Interests:
Bridget F.B. Algee-Hewitt is a biological anthropologist who studies skeletal and genetic trait variation in modern humans. Her research combines data analytic and hands-on laboratory approaches to the estimation of the personal identity parameters – like sex, ancestry, stature, and age – that are essential components of the biological profile used in forensic identification of unknown human remains and for the paleodemographic reconstruction of past population histories in bioarchaeology. Concerns for social justice, human rights, and issues of group disparities underlie much of her work. As a practicing forensic anthropologist and geneticist, she provides forensic casework consultation to the medico-legal community.
Education:
PhD Biological Anthropology, University of Tennessee – Knoxville
MA Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology, Bryn Mawr College
BA Classics and Art History, Mount Allison University
