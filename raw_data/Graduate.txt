About - M.S. in Data Science
We are excited to offer a new 30-credit MS degree in Interdisciplinary Data Science (IDS) with a major in Scientific Computing beginning in Fall 2021!
Data is exploding all around us and will keep growing at dizzying rates for the foreseeable future in fields as unique as health, material science, finance, biology, the internet of things, experimental physics, law, art, and psychology, along with many others. Tools of choice to analyze these data revolve around model reduction, probability, data, and machine learning. On the demand side, industry, government, and national labs are clamoring for a workforce skilled in artificial intelligence, machine learning, predictive analysis, and data modeling. Our students will graduate with a Master’s degree, preparing them to succeed in a world where computation, mathematics, and statistics have become fundamental necessities. They will create the next generation computational algorithms necessary to model, manipulate, analyze, visualize, and transform unstructured, structured, static, and streaming data.
A core set of Statistics, Mathematics, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Ethics courses will create a strong core of fundamentals upon which to build. Students will further specialize and strengthen their skills through electives taken in Scientific Computing and the other three majors (Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science), such as High-Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, and Probabilistic Programming.

Ph.D. in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Apply Now!
GRADUATE PROGRAM IN
GEOPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS
ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING AND THE GEOPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS INSTITUTE (GFDI)
COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES
PROGRAM OVERVIEW
The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program leads to a degree in Computational Sciences with a major in either GFD or Fire Dy-namics. It is an interdisciplinary field of study whose primary goal is an improvement in our basic understanding of fluid flows that occur naturally, including such topics as climate and paleoclimate, biogeochemical processes, hydrology and Karst dynamics, air-sea interaction, wild fire dynamics, double diffusive processes, and hurricane dynamics with strong links to the Applied Mathematics Pro-gram. The approach to this understanding is through quantitative analysis of observational records and theoretical, mathematical, numer-ical, and experimenting modeling. A geophysical fluid dynamicist must have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of classical phys-ics, knowledge of the techniques of applied mathematics, and an interest in the natural sciences. It follows that the course of study leading to a degree in geophysical fluid dynamics is a rewarding one in which the student gains an overview of the geophysical sciences not available from study in a single discipline.
The interdepartmental graduate program of study leads to the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree; there is no master’s degree offered. The program is administered by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute and has its own separate degree requirements. It differs from the regular departmental offerings in the earth sciences mainly by its interdisciplinary approach and emphasis on the fundamentals of mathematics, physics, and fluid dynamics, with less emphasis on descriptive material from any one discipline.
A major factor in the success of this PhD program is the strong support provided by the Departments of Earth, Ocean and Atmos-pheric Science (EOAS), Mathematics, Physics, Scientific Computing, and Statistics, and the College of Engineering. In particular, these departments offer a wide range of courses from which the student in geophysical fluid dynamics constructs an individualized curriculum. Faculty members of various departments who have an active research interest in geophysical fluid dynamics form the heart of the pro-gram by serving as advisors and instructors for the students in the program.
Facilities are situated in the
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute
, whose primary function is to support and foster those theoreti-cal, experimental, numerical, and observational studies of natural environmental fluid flows that transcend the traditional departmental disciplines.
FACILITIES
These facilities include a large modern laboratory for hydrodynamics experiments, a colloquium room and reading room (furnished with books and periodicals in fluid dynamics, classical physics, applied mathematics, geophysical sciences, and astrophysical sciences), a photographic and illustrations laboratory, a large modern machine shop, a precision instrument-makers laboratory, and faculty and stu-dent offices. Institute facilities also include several precision rotating turntables, a six-meter water channel, convection tanks, tempera-ture controlling systems, general and digital photographic systems, multi-channel data acquisition systems, laser facilities, various ma-chine tools, and other electronic equipment. The institute houses a facility for measuring ocean turbulence as well.

Title: Honors in the Major - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/undergraduate/bachelor-of-science/honors-in-the-major

Honors in the Major
Students earn Honors in the Major by completing a research thesis or creative project in your major area of study under the guidance of a faculty committee. You will work with this committee to select a topic, develop a prospectus, complete a written document based on your research or creative project, and defend your thesis orally before your committee. This process normally takes two to three semesters, during which you will register for six to nine hours of 4000-level thesis credit. Once you have completed and successfully defended your project, you will graduate "with honors" in your major, a distinction that is announced during commencement and designated on your official transcript (not your diploma).

Undergraduate Degree in Computational Science
The Department of Scientific Computing offers an innovative
B.S. degree program in Computational Science
.
This degree program should be of interest to and is well suited for those who like working on computers and who ordinarily would also be interested in any of the mathematical sciences (mathematics, computer science, statistics), or any of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, geological sciences, ...), or any engineering discipline. It should be of special interest to students interested in two or more of these areas. Students majoring in Computational Science will learn how to develop and apply new computational tools to solve science and engineering problems.
The
Department of Scientific Computing
is the focal point of computational science activities at FSU.
Computational science involves the invention, implementation, testing, and application of algorithms and software used to solve large-scale scientific and engineering problems. The Department provides a venue for innovative research and education in computational science. Our faculty come from a wide variety of traditional mathematical, scientific, and engineering disciplines who are primarily interested in developing knowledge and tools for computational science and applying those tools to the solution of problems in a variety of applications.
Please note that computational science is different from computer science. At the risk of oversimplifying things, one can say that computer science is about the science of computers whereas computational science is about the use of computers to solve science and engineering problems.
The undergraduate
Minor
and
B.S.
degree programs in Computational Science, along with the already established
Master's
and
Ph.D.
programs, trains students in computational science by providing them with a mix of theory and practice, including substantial hands-on experience in the deployment and use of algorithms for solving scientific and engineering problems.

The focus of the research and training activities of the DSC is on the invention, analysis, and implementation of computational algorithms that transcend disciplines and the application of such algorithms to various applications, including, among others, astrophysics, bioinformatics, climate and weather modeling, computational fluid mechanics, computational geometry, computer game design, evolutionary biology, data mining, GPU computing, high-energy density physics, high-performance computing, hydrology, machine learning, material science, medical imaging, morphometrics, nano-materials, numerical analysis, partial differential equations, phylogenetics, polymers, population genetics, scientific visualization, subsurface environmental modeling, superconductivity, systems biology, and uncertainty quantification.
Unlike the faculty of a typical department whose training and research interests lie solely within a single discipline, the faculty of the DSC includes members trained in a variety of disciplines - biology, aeronautical engineering, chemical engineering, geological sciences, electrical engineering, material sciences, mathematics, nuclear engineering, and physics. In addition, the DSC has several affiliated faculty members in other departments at FSU and at other universities, companies, and laboratories that further enhance the educational and research experiences of students in the DSC's degree programs.
In addition to offering degree programs, the DSC contributes to FSU's educational mission by offering courses of interest to students in other departments, by offering tutorials and short courses, and by managing high-performance computational resources available to the campus community.
