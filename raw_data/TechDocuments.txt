Title: BLAS - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/339-blas

BLAS
The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (
BLAS
) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software,
LAPACK
for example. The libraries are typically linked into your application. For example,if the libraries are stored on
/usr/local/lib
, use
-L/usr/local/lib -lf77blas
in your program linker step to link to these libraries. Detailed lists of functions can be found on the links above.

Title: Redhat Software Collections - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1017-redhat-software-collections

Redhat Software Collections
Sometimes more recent versions of programming tools are needed. To accomodate that without replacing the base operating system tools, Redhat has implemented software collections. This allows users to run gcc 4.9.x, python 2.7.x, etc. on a per application basis while maintaining well-tested operating system integrity.
scl
utility makes the switching simple.
The current gcc version is 4.4. To use gcc 4.9 in bash shell, run the following commands:
scl enable devtoolset-4 bash
gcc -v
gfortran -v
Likewise to use python 3.6, run the following:
scl enable rh-python36 bash 
python -V
By exiting that bash shell, users will return back to the default system tools.
Other useful commands:
cat my_script | scl enable rh-python36 - 
scl -l devtoolset-4
The first command runs my_script using python3.6 from the current shell (note the dash in the end). The second lists the packages included in collection devtoolset-4.

Title: Introduction to CPython - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1163-cpython

Introduction to CPython
This tutorial will run through using cpython on DSC machines.
Click on any image to view it in a lightbox.
The Basics
For starters, let's get python to run the eponymous hello world program. The first thing to do is navigate to your preferred source code storage location, and write the hello world program.
Then, start the command prompt.
And then navigate to your program location.
Then, run the python interpreter.
Other Features
At some point you may build up a code library that you would like to reference. Python contains options to ease the reuse of old code. In order to explore these options, lets compute the factorial of five. First, go to your prefered source directory, and write the program. The program is split up into two files: one that contains a factorial algorithm inside a module, and one that makes use of that module. The two files are split into disparate directories.
Start up the command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the main program. Now, whenever python runs, it searches for code libraries based on the environment variables
PYTHONHOME
and
PYTHONPATH
. In order for python to be able to find the factorial function, its folder must be on the
PYTHONPATH
. So, set the variable (on Windows, setting a variable in the command prompt only affects that command prompt).
Now just run the main program, and you should find that 5! = 120.

Title: Linux Modules - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1177-linux-modules

Linux Modules
On our Linux systems, most software resources are made available via modules.  Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the shared modulefiles.
This allows us to offer a large array of software to many users without the packages interfering with each other.
Using built-in modules
We provide many built-in modules for loading software packages and compilers.  You can see a list of these by running
$ ls /etc/modulefiles/*
OR
$ module avail
on any Desktop, Hallway, or Classroom workstation.
Let's say, for example, you wish to use MPI. You can use the
/etc/modulefiles/mpi/openmpi-x86_64
to make openmpi available to your shell.
To do this, simply run:
$ module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64
To show the current list of loaded modules, run:
$ module list
If you want to unload a module, run:
$ module unload mpi/openmpi-x86_64
Creating custom modules
You may wish to customize the Linux environment for your jobs on your own. You can create your own custom module to accomplish this.
First, create a directory for your modules:
$ mkdir ~/modules
Then, add the module path to the end of your
~/.bashrc
file:
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:${HOME}/modules
or add the following to your
~/.cshrc
or
~/.tcshrc
if you use the tcsh shell:
setenv MODULEPATH ${MODULEPATH}:${HOME}/modules
A module can be as simple as setting a few environment variables (such as
PATH
and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
) or can be complicated Tcl scripts.
You can refer to any of our existing modules in the
/etc/modulefiles
directory as templates for creating your own.  For example, the
/etc/modulefiles/orca
module includes the following directives:
Provide basic information about what the module does:
#%Module 1.0
#
#  Orca module
#
module-whatis  "Set path for orca."
Add the ORCA executable directory to the path, so that ORCA runs when the 'orca' command is typed:
prepend-path   PATH /panfs/storage.local/opt/orca_3_0_0_linux_x86-64
Set an environment variable necessary for ORCA to run:
setenv         RSH_COMMAND ssh
Running
module load orca
will make those alterations to the environment.  running
module unload orca
will remove them.
For a more complex example, refer to
/etc/modulefiles/gaussian09
.  This module file examines what  architecture the module is run and adjusts its paths accordingly.
For a complete reference of module file directives, refer to the modulefile man page (
man modulefile
).

Title: Linux Commands Cheat Sheet - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1302-linux-commands-cheatsheet

Linux Commands Cheat Sheet
Below are a number of commonly used commands in unix. For almost every command, there are additional flags that can be used to modify the command's behavior. For example, typing 'ls' in the terminal displays the files contained within the current working directory, but 'ls -l' displays them in a list format. Additionally, 'ls -lt' displays them in a list, but also in order of modification time. Information on what flags can be used, along with general explanations about the commands, can be found by typing 'man' before the command. Ex: 'man ls'.

Navigation:

Basic navigation is performed using a few commands:

cd: Short for 'change directory', changes the current working directory.

ls: Short for 'list', lists all of the files in the current working directory.

cwd: Short for 'current working directory', lists the absolute path to the directory the user is in.

clear: Clears the terminal of all text, although the previous text can still be seen by scrolling up.

In navigating a Unix file structure, a number of shorthand notations should be mentioned. Example usage of the above commands are shown here as well:

'~': The location of a user's home directory. When logging into a unix machine, you are likely going to begin in your home directory, where your personal files will be located. Typing 'ls' while in the home directory will display folders like 'Desktop', Pictures', 'Downloads', and 'Documents'. To move into one of these folders, one can type, e.g., 'cd Downloads'. Additionally, to display the contents of the 'Downloads' folder without navigating to it, type 'ls Downloads'.

'/': The machine's root directory. This is the highest level directory that contains all other files and folders in the machine. Programming libraries, system files, etc are found within the folders here. Typing 'cwd' in any directory will display the path from the root directory to the current working directory. For example, if the user's name was 'tom', typing 'cwd' while in the 'Downloads' folder will display '/home/tom/Downloads'.

'.': The current directory is represented with a simple period. Typing 'cd .' moves you to the current working directory, i.e. to where you are now.

'..': The directory above the current working directory. Ex: If you're in the directory ~/Downloads/, typing 'cd ..' will bring you to the home directory.

'-': This represents the last directory you were in. Ex: If you were in '~/Downloads' and moved to '/lib64/', typing 'cd -' would move you back to '~/Downloads' and 'ls -' would display the files within '~/Downloads'.

Creating, deleting, moving, renaming files/folders:

mkdir: Short for 'make directory', creates a directory with a given name. Ex: 'mkdir ~/Desktop/DSC' creates a folder 'DSC' in the 'Desktop' folder in your home directory.

rmdir: Short for 'remove directory', deletes a directory. Note that there are no backups, so be careful when using this command.

touch: Generally used to create a file with a given name. Ex: 'touch ~/Downloads/example.txt' creates an empty file named 'example.txt' in the Downloads folder and closes it. This command was originally used to update the time a file was accessed/modified -- 'touching' it by opening it if it exists, not modifying anything, and closing it.

cp: Short for 'copy', simply copies a file. Ex: If a file named 'example.txt' were in the Downloads folder and the Downloads folder is the current working directory, we could copy it into to the Desktop by using 'cp example.txt ~/Desktop/'. We could also rename the copy something else by using 'cp example.txt ~/Desktop/example2.txt'. To copy a folder, the '-rf' flag is required, as it needs to recursively copy all the files within the folder if they are present. 

mv: Short for 'move', moves a file from one place to another, and is often used to rename a file. This command effectively does the same thing as 'cp', only that the original file is removed. 

rm: Short for 'remove', deletes a file. Note that there are no backups of these files, so be careful when using this command. When deleting a directory, use 'rm -rf' or 'rmdir'. 

locate: Searches the entirety of the file structure for a file/directory with a given name.

Additional tips:

Tab-completion: When typing in commands, especially when trying to navigate file structures, using the tab key can auto-complete the names of files/folders if they are present. If nothing auto-completes after typing tab once, type it again to see all possible options. Similar to our example above under the 'cp' explanation, if we were to type 'ls ~/Desktop/example' and hit tab twice, it would show 'example.txt' and 'example2.txt'. Typing in '.' would then let it auto-complete the word 'example.txt' after hitting tab again.

Arrows: Use the up arrow to access previous commands that have been typed in. Using the down arrow after using the up arrow will go back down the list of commands. 

Permissions: A fundamental part of the unix file system is permissions (which cannot be fully explained here) and is generally accessed by using 'ls -l', i.e. displaying a folder's contents in list format. If you cannot read or modify a file, check the permissions. The permissions are on the left and dictate who can and cannot read (r), write (w), or execute (x) files in Unix (called access modes). Ex: If one has read access, the 'r' will be displayed. If one does not have read access, the 'r' column will be replaced with a dash '-'. Further, these are split into three sets. The first set of access modes are the permissions of the file's owner (the first name beside the permissions). The second set are the permissions of the file's group (the second name beside the permissions). The third set is the permissions for everyone else. Ex: If a file has only read access, the permissions would read '-r--r--r--'. This means that the user, the user's group, and anyone else can open and read the contents of the file. If it had read, write, and execute access for only the user, it would read '-rwxr--r--'. Here the user can open the file to read its contents, save edits to it, and execute it (if it's a program or a script), but everyone else can only read its contents. If it further had execute access for the user's group, it would read '-rwxr-xr--'. Finally, notice that all of these examples have a leading '-'. This is replaced with a 'd' only if it is a directory. In that case, the number beside the permissions would display how many files are in the folder. 

A final example for a folder named 'DSC' with 3 files in it owned by a user named 'tom' in the group 'users' with read, write, and execute permissions for the user 'tom', read and execute permissions for the group 'users', and read permissions for everyone else, with a byte size of 1000 and last modified on August 1st, 2017, would be:
  drwxr-xr-- 3 tom users 1000 Aug 1 2017 DSC

Title: Python Jungle - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1416-python-jungle

Python Jungle
Python 2 will soon be obsolete. Python 3 can be a challenge to navigate. It is strongly recommended to use virtual environment to manage python projects. Don't use system python for your projects.
Here is an example to start a project named isc3313. This approach will isolate python issues to the specific environment without impacting anything else.
scl enable rh-python36 bash
virtualenv isc3313
source isc3313/bin/activate
Manage anything needed for this project
pip install tensorflow...
To exit the environment, run
deactivate
To determine if you are running a particular Software Collection:
echo $X_SCLS
To test a Software Collection state, use "
scl_enabled rh-python36
" exit code.
To run script using python3.6 through Redhat Software Collection, use the following script template
#!/usr/bin/scl enable rh-python36 -- python3
import sys
version = "Python %d.%d" % (sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor)
print("You are running Python",version)

Title: Printing - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/179-printing

Printing
To use the department's printers you must be connected to the local network. This mean that if you are working off campus or using the campus wireless network you must first connect to the department's VPN (see VpnSetup for more details). Assume you have network access and permission to the printers, you may
set them up as described here
.
Note: The department
print server
uses the "CUPS" software. Consolidation of printing services will change this.
Poster Printing
Posters are only printed for Department of Scientific Computing faculty and students.
Requests to print posters must be made/endorsed by an SC faculty member and are approved by the SC Director.
Printer etiquette
When you submit a job to a printer, please retrieve your output as soon as possible. Output which is left in the copy room over 24 hours will be thrown away.
When you do pick up your output, and it is located within a large stack of pages, please do so carefully so as to not disturb the output of other users. Don't pull out pages while the printer is printer and then try to put them back. This leads to "shuffling" the pages and leads to a lot of confusion. Please dispose of unnecessary pages in the recycling boxes located on the floor beneath the counters, and in the trays designated for this purpose nearby all of the printers.
Please respect the resourses. Do NOT try to clear jams, or correct problems with the printers, even if on weekends. Our printers are not covered under warranty, and repairs are very expensive. Send email to sysops or to Dana Lutton.
Known Printer Problems
Acrobat files may not print from Windows to the pr483 QMS 860 printer. This printer is a Level 2 PostScript and most current Acrobat files contain Level 3 PostScript commands in them.
The pr473 HP printer is also a Level 2 PostScript printer and will not print Level 3 PostScript files. You will need to set your application to print Level 2 PostScript only.
It is recommended that you not print manual paperfeed jobs from UNIX where the printer must pause and wait for the manual feed tray to be loaded.
Level 3 PostScript commands primarily deal with the "color" definitions and commands, and are the primary cause of printing problems on Level 2 PostScript printers.
Problems printing PhotoShop files. Some Adobe PhotoShop files contain binary information prior to the %!PS, and following the %EOF. To properly print these files you must remove the binary information from the begin and the end of the file. This especially applies to people who must incorporate them into (La)TeX documents using dvips.
All PostScript files must contain %!PS as the first 4 characters. If your file doesn't print, this is a likely cause.
PostScript files received by email may contain aberrant characters, at the end of line, or beginning of new lines. Binary portions of files received by email may be truncated, and will not print.
Problems with lpr and EPS files. EPS files are "encapsulated" and contain no "printer specific" information. To print an EPS file using the lpr file.eps command you need to have a "utility wrapper" surrounding this code.
Web pages and PDF files containing graphics are a whole "other" issue -- many of them cannot be printed because they were incorrectly made to begin with.
If a PDF was made with special fonts that are not installed on a printer the file will not print correctly. Authors should be encouraged to embed all fonts into their pdf document to avoid this problem.

Title: vscode Proxy through SSH Tunnel - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/1831-vscode

vscode Proxy through SSH Tunnel
If you want to use vscode to connect to targetHost.sc.fsu.edu from a computer at home through proxy pamd.sc.fsu.edu, please use the following steps.
Feel free to email
This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
if you have any difficulty.
Configure SSH for ProxyJump
You'll want to add a configuration for targetHost.sc.fsu.edu in your SSH config file to use pamd.sc.fsu.edu as an intermediate (jump) host.
Open or create the SSH configuration file using whatever text editor you prefer, we use nano as an example:
nano ~/.ssh/config
Add the following settings to the SSH configuration file ~/.ssh/config:
Host pamd
    HostName pamd.sc.fsu.edu
    User fsuid
Host targetHost
    HostName targetHost.sc.fsu.edu
    User fsuid
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<private_key_for_targetHost>
    ProxyJump pamd
Make sure the IdentityFile points to the correct SSH private key for each host.
Set Up the SSH Extension in VS Code
Install the Remote - SSH extension for VS Code if you haven't already:
Go to Extensions and search for "Remote - SSH."
Install the extension.
Open the Command Palette in VS Code and search for "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..."
Type targetHost.sc.fsu.edu (or the alias name you set in ~/.ssh/config for targetHost) and select it.
VS Code will automatically use the SSH config you defined, routing the connection through pamd to reach targetHost.
Verify Connection
Once connected, VS Code should open a remote session on targetHost. You can confirm the connection by checking the VS Code terminal, which should indicate it's connected to targetHost. Now you can open files, run commands, and work as if you were directly connected to targetHost.

Title: Thunderbird FAQ - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/233-thunderbird-faq

Thunderbird FAQ
Thunderbird works largely the same on all platforms: Linux, Windows and Macintosh. For users working on more than one platform, Thunderbird can be a significant benefit comparing with other email clients. The solutions given here may vary slightly in naming and layout depending on the platforms. If you need to setup Thunderbird, consult
this page
first.
How to turn on/off email forwarding from fsu.edu?
Login http://webmail.fsu.edu
From top menus, click Options/Mail/Settings
Check/uncheck "Enable forwarding"
Be careful not to create forwading loops with other email accounts!
How to display the size and number of messages in a folder?
Go to "Preferences / Advanced / General"
Check "Show expanded colums in the folder pane"
In the folder pane, click on the icon next to "Name" column and select Total and/or Size
Likewise each message size can be displayed by clicking on the icon in the email pane
How to setup reply above/before the original message?
Go to "Account Settings... / Composition & Addressing" of the mailbox in question
Check "Automatically quote the original message when replying"
Then, "Start my reply above the quote"
and place my signature "below my reply (above the quote)" if preferred
How to setup FSU address book?
Go to "Preferences / Composition / Addressing"
Check "Directory Server"
Click on "Edit Directories..." and "Add" buttons
Enter the fields as shown (Hostname: addressbook.fsu.edu) below and make sure to use your own
"Bind DN: uid=fsuid,ou=people,dc=fsu,dc=edu".
After saving the settings, go to "Offline" tab and click on "Download Now", which should help with adddres completion performance.
Under the "Directory Server" drop-down menu, select the address book just created.
Now you should be able to get automatic address completion for FSU email addresses.
How to keep local copies of IMAP messages?
Go to "Account Settings... / Offline & Disk Space" of the mailbox in question
Check "When I create new folders, select them for offline use"
Click on "Select folders for offline use..." button and check folders you want to keep local copies.
This is helpful on laptops so you can still read old messages when network connections are not available.
If you wonder where the messages are saved, go to "Accoutn Settings / Server Settings", "Local directory" should display the folder.
How to change the original message indicator from the colored bars to the traditional >?
Go to "Account Settings...
/
Composition & Addressing
"
Uncheck "Compose messages in HTML format"
This is equivalent to "mail.identity.default.compose_html = false"
How to setup calendar in Thunderbird?
Download
Lightning plugin
for Thunderbird, which also provide "Tasks" service
One main drawback of the Tasks is the inability to save tasks and to transport them. If you have Gmail account, you are encouraged to use
Google Calendar
and its Tasks service instead.
Lightening plugin serves as a portal for various calendars you may have: FSU calendars, Google calendars and others. If you prefer a separate application altogether, use
Sunbird
. It is better to use Lightning plugin to only view the various calendars since changing calendar events may require complicated authentications. Its reminders may not be working properly each time you reload the calendars. SyncCGP plugin may help where Lightning is lacking, but we will try to keep things simple for now.
Install Lightning as follows
In Thunderbird, go to
          "Tools / Add-ons"
Click "Install" button, and select the file you 
          downloaded and click "OK". Restart Thunderbird.
Under Calendar, go to "Calendar / New Calendar..."
Select "On the network" and click "Next".
For Google calendars, select "iCalendar" and enter in the "Location" with the private URL
provided by Google
unless your calendar is publicly available
For FSU calendars, select "Sun Java System Calendar Server (WCAP)" with "Location: https://webmail.fsu.edu:83" as shown below
FSU calendars can be configured via http://webmail.fsu.edu. Refers to
this

Title: Hosting Policy - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/287-hosting-policy

Hosting Policy
Support for non-DSC HPC systems
The DSC plays a major rule in the support of FSU's computational infrastructure by providing expert technical support in advanced computing. In addition to the management of FSU's shared multidisciplinary HPC (see http://hpc.fsu.edu), the DSC has also invested a large sum of funds to develop a computing facility located in the center of the main FSU campus. This facility is currently equipped with 1000 square feet of raised floor, battery backup power, high-speed network connectivity to the campus network backbone and the Florida Lambda Rail, and 80 tons of cooling.
As part of it's service to University, the DSC hosts computational servers owned by other FSU academic units on a first-come, first-served basis until 25% of the DSC machine room cooling, electrical, or floor capacity is reached. Once the capacity of the room is reached, the DSC will not support additional machines.
Eligibility
All units within the College of Arts and Sciences are eligible to have machines hosted in the DSC computer room.  The DSC's Local Systems Committee will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis and will agree to host machines provided the capacity allocated for non-DSC systems has not been reached and the requirements listed below are met.
Requirements
Each of the requirements enumerated below is described in greater detail in the following pages.
The DSC is not responsible for incidental costs associated with the installation or maintenance of computer systems hosted in the DSC computer room.
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a detailed hardware proposal.
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a proposal describing how the computer systems will be managed.
Computer systems hosted in DSC computer room are required to run the DSC load distribution system.
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a designated faculty liaison from within the unit making the request.
For questions or information regarding availability contact Jim Wilgenbusch at 645-0307 or
This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
.
1. Incidental costs
In addition to the substantial costs of providing a cold room with reliable power, there are a number of "incidental" costs associated with hosting computer systems.   These costs include server racks, power distribution units (PDUs or power strips), and network switches.  The DSC is not responsible for covering incidental costs.  At a minimum, the DSC will provide a single outlet for each electrical circuit required to power the computer system and a single 10/100/1000 network uplink in the vicinity of the computer system.  The cost of incidentals (e.g., racks, PDUs, and network connectivity) can either be included in the price of a fully integrated system or the DSC will provide these items at cost.  In order to avoid half empty racks, the later option may be required. For example, if a group plans to purchase a small number of servers, then the DSC would prefer to use an existing rack, PDU, and network switch.  In this case, costs will be assessed according to the portion of the resource being used.
2. Hardware proposal
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a detailed hardware proposal.  An agreement to house a computer system in the DSC computer room is limited to the hardware described in the proposal.  This requirement is intended to safeguard against someone purchasing hardware that is in some way incompatible with the DSC machine room infrastructure.  In addition, the hardware proposal is needed to estimate the power, space, and cooling requirements of the computer system so that we do not exceed the capacity of the DSC computer room.  The DSC has a wealth of experience with numerous hardware vendors and can create the hardware proposal on the behalf of unit making the request.
Hardware proposals must include the following information:
Server rack dimensions *
Switch type and size *
PDU type and quantity *
Chassis type per unit
CPU type and quantity per unit
Motherboard type per unit
Ethernet or network adapter type and quantity per unit
Hard drive type and quantity per unit
Memory type and quantity per unit
Type and quantity of all peripheral devises that will be part of the computer system (e.g. disk arrays, CD/DVD drives, etc.)
* if not using equipment provided by the DSC
3. Management proposal
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a proposal describing how the computer system will be managed.  Two general administrative options are available; 1. the DSC will manage the computer system, and  2. the unit making the request will manage the computer system.
Option 1: DSC manages the computer system
Option 1 gives a group access to a computational resource without the hassle of having to administer it.  The DSC will agree to manage a computer system only if the DSC is given discretion to choose the hardware, the operating system, and the tools used to update and distribute software on the computer system. The DSC systems manager determines who is granted access to privileged commands. Access to privileged commands will be controlled by the "sudo" command; root logins are not permitted. Only members of the DSC systems group will know the root password. The DSC systems manager will determine the update cycle of the core operating system and system software.
Option 2: Non-DSC unit manages the computer system
If a unit chooses to manage their own computer system, then a qualified systems administrator must be designated to manage the resource.  The required management proposal must address in detail how the designated systems administrator will tend the following tasks: account management, disk management, network management, system installation, software management, security, systems management, user support, hardware support, and administration of purchase and warranty information. Systems not managed by the DSC will be relegated to a separate secure network.  A firewall will monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic and the DSC systems manager will determine the stringency of the firewall. Access the machine room will be limited to the designated systems administrator.  Members of the DSC systems group will have root access to all systems housed in the DSC computer room.
4. Cycle sharing
In order to maximize throughput on DSC and non-DSC computational servers and cluster nodes, the DSC uses a job scheduling and queuing system called Condor (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/). All of the computer systems housed in the DSC computer room must participate in this system.  The Condor system allows fine-grain configuration of policies to support distributively owned computing resources.  For example, specific nodes can be configured to "prefer" jobs submitted by specific users. This way, a resource owner will have limited access to all of the DSC computational resources and guaranteed access to his or her machines. This system ensures that cycles are not wasted if the primary resource owner is not using them.
While the Condor system provides some important advantages to managing and distributing computationally intensive jobs, a resource owner is not obligated to use it.  For example, a resource owner can run jobs interactively on any of his or her computer systems and his or her jobs will preempt jobs managed by the Condor system.  Circumventing the Condor system in this way is to the disadvantage of the resource owner, however.   By submitting jobs through the Condor system, a resource owner will not only have guaranteed access to his or her machines, but the Condor system will also provide access to the other machines housed in the DSC machine room.
5. Faculty Liaison
Requests to house computer systems in the DSC computer room must include a designated faculty liaison from within the unit making the request. The liaison will be responsible for conveying information to the users of the computer system housed in the DSC computer room.  If the DSC agrees to manage a computer system, the faculty liaison is responsible for approving account requests, requesting changes to a user's priority, and requesting software installations.  The authority to make these requests can be transferred to a designate person (e.g., graduate student) at the written request of the faculty liaison.

Title: MATLAB - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/325-matlab

MATLAB
MATLAB, the MATrix LABratory, is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numeric computation. Using MATLAB, you can solve technical computing problems faster than with traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran.  For more see:
MathWorks MATLAB website
and
Origins of MATLAB
.
The primary benefits of developing a project with MATLAB include: efficient, concise array manipulations; availability of many already-implemented numerical routines (via the standard distribution, add-on toolboxes, or online software repositories); and the large community of users available for support. One particularly active MATLAB community and software repository is MATLAB Central. For more see:
MATLAB Central
Toolboxes
Toolboxes are add-ons to the standard MATLAB distribution. They provide additional functionality within a targeted application area. DSC has the following toolboxes available (current as of Spring 2009):
Control System Toolbox
Fixed-Point Toolbox
Image Processing Toolbox
Mapping Toolbox
Neural Network Toolbox
Optimization Toolbox
Partial Differential Equation Toolbox
Signal Processing Toolbox
Statistics Toolbox
System Identification Toolbox
Wavelet Toolbox
For more see:
MathWorks Product Listing
High-Performance Computing with MATLAB
Beginning with MATLAB R2007b, new features have been implemented in the official MathWorks MATLAB distribution that allow for parallel and distributed computing. The MATLAB Distributed Computing Engine, used in conjunction with Distributed Computing Toolbox, enables MATLAB and Simulink users to execute applications on a computer cluster.  For more see:
Cleve's Corner: Parallel MATLAB: Multiple Processors and Multiple Cores
.
MatlabMPI is set of MATLAB scripts that implement a subset of MPI and allow any MATLAB program to be run on a parallel computer. The key innovation of MatlabMPI is that it implements the widely used MPI look and feel on top of standard MATLAB file i/o, resulting in a pure MATLAB implementation that is exceedingly small (~300 lines of code). Thus, MatlabMPI will run on any combination of computers that MATLAB supports.  For more see:
MATLAB MPI
.
Running MATLAB
With the exception of the classroom and hallway computers, MATLAB access is available only on the
General Purpose (GP) Cluster through SGE
. Unless initiated through an X11-capable terminal (i.e. Gnome Terminal, xterm, rxvt, etc.), MATLAB will start in a text-only command-line mode.
NOTE:
To force MATLAB to run in command-line mode use the following flags:
matlab -nodesktop -nojvm -nosplash
-nodesktop
Start MATLAB without its desktop.
-nojvm
Start MATLAB without the Java virtual machine (JVM).
-nosplash

In Batch Mode
There are circumstances where a user would want to run MATLAB without its graphical user interface (GUI). For example, a user may want call a MATLAB script from a Makefile, or submit multiple batch jobs to a queuing system.
From a Makefile
Use the following syntax:
cd WORKING_DIRECTORY && matlab -nosplash -nojvm -r PATH_TO_MATLAB_SCRIPT
where
WORKING_DIRECTORY
is the directory that MATLAB will work in.
PATH_TO_MATLAB_SCRIPT
is the path to the MATLAB m-file you wish to run

R
R is a language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics.  It is a
GNU
project
which is similar to the S language and environment which
was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.  R can be considered as
a different implementation of S. There are some important differences,
but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is
highly extensible.  The S language is often the vehicle of choice for
research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source
route to participation in that activity.
One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed
publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
symbols and formulae where needed.  Great care has been taken over the 
defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user
retains full control.
R is available as Free Software under the terms of the
Free Software Foundation
's
GNU General Public License
in source code
form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and
similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

g++
The command
g++
invokes the C++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes
.C
,
.cc
,
.cpp
,
.c++
,
.cp
, or
.cxx
; preprocessed C++ files use the suffix
.ii
. GCC recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++ even when invoked as
gcc
.  However, C++ programs often require additional class libraries, and under some circumstances you might want to compile programs from standard input, or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs.
g++
is a program that calls GCC with the default language set to C++, and automatically specifies linking against the C++ library.
When you compile C++ programs,  you may specify many of the same command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs. These options may be found in the
GCC documentation

Super LU
Super LU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large,

machines. The library is written in C and is callable from either C or
Fortran. The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with
partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering for
sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative backward
error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.

Title: Using SSH - FSUSciComp

Using SSH
Passwordless authentication
Note:
Passwordless authentication has been disabled on the
pamd
servers. However, once inside our network you can setup passwordless ssh to other hosts normally.
Below you'll find the "barebones" steps needed to connect to a remote machine without having to enter your password. This is NOT a comprehensive explanation of how ssh or passwordless authentication works, rather it is simply some notes that I've kept to get ssh to work for my purposes. You should also know that setting up passwordless authentication for
your account and machine will expose you to at least one security vulnerability. For example, if someone logged into your account on your machine then they can access any other machine that has been configured to accept passwordless authentication. That said, here's how to do it.
There are two versions of ssh and each version has a slightly
different way of authenticating. I'll break things down into multiple
parts to cover all of the ways you could connect to the different
clients. To find out what version off ssh you are using type:
ssh -V
You'll either get something that has the string OpenSSH in it or something like this,
SSH Secure Shell 3.1.0 non-commercial version
. I'll refer to the former as OpenSSH and to the later as ssh.com
OpenSSH to OpenSSH
Most SCS systems are configured to use OpenSSH, which will make your life considerably more simple. The most notable exception to this is the IBM SP machines. The IBMs use the ssh.com version of ssh. It is still possible to connect to machines using differenct implementations of SSH, but it adds an extra layer of work that I will talk about later. In this section I'll discuss how to setup passwordless authentication between a host and a server running openSSH.
First, you need to create a public key using the following command:
ssh-keygen -t dsa
You'll be prompted for a passphrase and you might be prompted to name the identity files. Leave them blank and hit return.
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_dsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
af:02:20:6e:05:96:84:5a:cc:2c:0a:1e:db:bb:1c:8b
In this step, two files were generated; one is the local identity file (id_dsa) and the other is the public key that will go into a specific file on the remote host. If the remote host mounts your SC home directory then this step is simple. Change directories to thehidden ssh configuration directory:
cd ~/.ssh
Copy the contents of id_dsa.pub into the authorized_keys2 file.
cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2
Notice that I've used the append redirect (>>) because you can have multiple host identity keys in the same authorized_keys2 file. The important thing here is that each key must occupy its own line. If you don't yet have an
authorized_keys2
file then you can do something like this:
cat id_dsa.pub > authorized_keys2
That's it. You should now be able to logon to a remote host that is mounting your SCS home directory without having to type in your password. If you are attempting to connect to a remote server that doesn't mount the the CSIT user file system then you will need to copy the public key to the sever and paste or redirect the file into the authorized_keys2 file. For example:
scp ./id_dsa.pub faroffserver.bingo.org:.ssh/.
ssh remoteHost.bingo.org
remoteHost> cd .ssh
remoteHost> cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2
note! if the file doesn't exist you'll need to do this:
remoteHost> cat id_dsa.pub > authorized_keys2
OpenSSH to ssh.com
Now you want to connect to a remote server using the ssh.com implementation of ssh from a host that's using OpenSSH. This would be the case if you wanted to connect to one of SCS's IBM machines from most of the other SCS machines. Start by generating an ssh.com (SECSH) formatted public key from the OpenSSH public key already in your .ssh directory and put the new key in the right place. Here's what you'll do:
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -e -f id_dsa.pub > id_dsa_secsh.pub
SSH.com stores it's configuration files in a hidden directory called .ssh2. If you are trying to connect to a remote machine that mounts the SCS user file system then you'll need to create the .ssh2 directory if doesn't already exist.
mkdir ~/.ssh2
cd ~/.ssh2
Next you will need to copy the new file to the .ssh2 directory and configure the authorization file so that it knows where to look to find the key.
cp ~/.ssh/id_dsa_secsh.pub ~/.ssh2/.
echo Key id_dsa_secsh.pub >> authorization
Again, if the authorization file doesn't exist then you'll need to do:
echo Key id_dsa_secsh.pub > authorization
That's it. If the remote server to which you are trying to connect does not mount the DSC file system then you will copy the key file to the remote machine and then logon to the machine and make the changes described above.
SSH.com to OpenSSH
Much of what is needed in the section is covered more verbosely
above so I'm going to stick to the commands needed to configure a local
host running ssh.com (local) to connect to a remote host running
OpenSSH (remote).
local> ssh-keygen -t dsa
local> echo IdKey id_dsa_1024_a > identification
local> scp id_dsa_1024_a.pub remote.fsu.edu:.ssh/.
remote> cd .ssh
remote> ssh-keygen -f id_dsa_1024_a.pub -i > newkey.pub
remote> cat newkey.pub >> authorized_keys2
That's it.

Title: Printing FAQ - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/352-printerfaq

Printing FAQ
DSC has consolidated all of its printing and copying options under one contract with three Konica Minolta multifunction printers.  As part of this contract, the department is now charged 6 cents per color page, 1 cent per grayscale page.  For this reason we have implemented a print accounting systems based on Pykota on top of CUPS.  If you have any problems with printing please consult the FAQ below.  If you do not find your answer here please contact TSG with your job number and a description of the issue.
Q: What is my quota?
A: The default quotas were determined by the department to be $30 per semester (6months) for faculty and $10 per semester (6 months) for students.  Color pages cost 6 cents per page, grayscale 1 cent per page.
Q: How do I find out the current balance of my quota?
A: We have made an interface for you to review the quota and print jobs that can be found from the print quota link on the main page (note you must be logged in to see this).
Q: Why don't I have a quota set?
A: If you have no quota set this means you aren't listed as being part of the department, if this is a mistake please contact
This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
and we will correct it.
Q: Can I still print if I have no quota or I have used it all up?
A: Yes you should still be able to print if you add more credit to the account.
Q: How do I increase my quota if I need it?
A: You can contact Michele Locke and arrange for additional money to be placed on your account that will allow you to print additional pages.
Q: I am printing from my personal laptop, why do none of my jobs get printed?
A: When printing from your personal computer it is important to make sure that the username of your own machine matches your SC/FSU username.  Each print job needs to correspond to a user for accountability. If printing with command lpr, this can be done with the -U
flag. It is also important to put your personal computer on the proper network via VPN or otherwise.
Q: My print job seems to sit around in the queue for a long time. Why?
A: There can be a lot of reasons.  The most important of which is that these are multifunction printers, if someone is copying or scanning with them, they will be unavailable for printing.  Check and see if the printer is busy.  Also only one print job can be sent to the printer at a time, this means that if someone else prints a job to a queue that is set for the same printer, one job will have to wait for the other to complete first.

Title: MPI - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/361-mpi

MPI
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a specification for an API that allows many computers to communicate with one another.  The MPI standard includes point-to-point message-passing, collective communications, group and communicator concepts, process topologies, environmental management, process creation and management, one-sided communications, extended collective operations, external interfaces, I/O, some miscellaneous topics, and a profiling interface. Language bindings for C, C++ and Fortran are defined.  OpenMPI and MPICH2 are two popular free MPI implementations.
Note:
At DSC, we currently support OpenMPI and MPICH2 on
owner-based clusters only
.
OpenMPI
The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners.  Open MPI is a project combining technologies and resources from several other projects (LAM/MPI, FT-MPI, LA-MPI, and PACX-MPI) in order to build the best MPI library available.  OpenMPI programs must be compiled and linked with the appropriate MPI compiler.  The user creates a special environment for jobs to run in.
MPICH2
MPICH2 is a freely available, portable implementation of
MPI
, the Standard for message-passing libraries. It implements both MPI-1 and MPI-2.  MPICH2 is supposed to be a compatible replacement for any MPICH version 1 implementation. MPICH2 requires users to build and link against the set of provided routines then run in a special environment. See the
MPICH2 documentation
for additional specifications.

Title: Owner-Based FAQs - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/383-owner-based-faqs

Owner-Based FAQs
How do I get an account on a cluster?
If you already have an DSC account, access can be requested through
SCUM
.
These requests will be sent to the cluster owner for approval.
If you do not already have an DSC account, you must first request a DSC sponsored account.
To request a DSC sponsored account, go to
SCUM
,
click on "Request a DSC Account", select "Sponsored Account", then select the DSC faculty member that will act as your account sponsor.
Once the account sponsor approves your request, you can request cluster access.
How do I log into the cluster?
Cluster resources (compute nodes, etc.) can only be accessed through the cluster headnode.
Inside the DSC network, cluster headnodes can be accessed using
ssh
.
For example, to log into a cluster called
phoenix
, type:
ssh phoenix
If you are outside the DSC network, you must first log into PAMD to get past our firewall:
ssh pamd.sc.fsu.edu
ssh phoenix
How do I compile programs?
Use the cluster headnode to compile programs intended to run on that cluster.
On the headnode, your default path will be set to allow access to all compilers available on that system.
For certain proprietary compilers, licensing issues will limit the number of simultaneous compilations allowed.
If a compilation job fails because there are no available licenses, be patient and wait for other users'
compilation processes to complete, then attempt your compilation again.
How do I run programs?
The headnode must be available to provide essential services to other cluster nodes,
so it is imperitive that resource-intensive programs are never run directly on the headnode.
Instead, all programs should be submitted via the cluster's queuing system.
Although
ssh
may be allowed to compute nodes, please refrain from using this ability to run jobs,
because this prevents the scheduler from optimally managing the cluster's resources.
How do I log into a specific node?
In the event that it is necessary to direcly access a specific cluster node interactively,
please use the cluster's queuing system.
qlogin -q [queue-name]
you will be given a login on a node of that type.
If you need to log into a specific node you can use the form
qlogin -q [queue-name]@[machine-name]
What are the differences between the MPI implementations?
In general, most MPI implementations provide the same functionality, but in slightly different ways.
OpenMPI provides many utilities that make it more portable and dynamic than the others,
making it the suggested platform for new software development.
Occasionally programs require features that are specific to another MPI implementation.
Other MPI implementations are available on certain clusters, but often are often less scheduler-friendly,
and have been known to leave processes running if a job dies unexpectedly.

Title: Macintosh System Configurations - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/computing/tech-docs/433-macintosh-setup

Macintosh System Configurations
Topics cover the basic system configurations for SC Macintosh clients running Leopard (OS X 10.5.x). Configurations for Tiger may vary somewhat. They allow users without local accounts to access the computer via LDAP. User files can also be saved on the network in a transparent manner. This is ideal for public Macintosh systems. Individual Macs can be configured as such with a slight twist: Mobile accounts. It provides the consistency and convenience of tapping into department resources and yet allows the freedom to logon when off campus.
Configure the System to Use LDAP Authentication
It may be necessary to reboot when LDAP settings have changed.
Start /Applications/Utilities/Directory Utility or /System/Library/CoreServices/Directory, unlock and show advanced settings if needed. You need administrator access to make any changes.
Under "Services" tab, edit LDAPv3
Click on "New..." button
Server Name or IP Address: ldap-vm0.sc.fsu.edu. Make sure "Encrypt using SSL" is unchecked, otherwise authentication will fail. As of this writing, this is a bug in Leopard. We can correct this setting later.
Continue and choose template: RFC 2307 (Unix) and enter searchbase: ou=people,dc=sc,dc=fsu,dc=edu
Save is as "LDAP" under "Configuration Name", click on "OK" to finish
Earlier than Leopard, secure LDAP connection is not mandated. Modify the mandate by editing
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf
TLS_REQCERT   demand ==> TLS_REQCERT   allow
Configure the System to Use LDAP SSL to Authenticate
Assume LDAP authentication is configured already and you need administrator privilege
