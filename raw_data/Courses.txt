Alan Lemmon
In this course, students will explore the different elements that determine the outcome of infectious disease in humans, using COVID-19 as a case study. Starting with a very basic model that includes susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, students will gradually incorporate factors that may affect the outcome of an outbreak, such as masking/quarantining, gain and loss of natural and vaccine-based immunity, and changing virulence/strains. After summarizing data already collected during the recent pandemic, students will inform the model to determine the conditions under which different outcomes may occur. Students will summarize their results graphically and present their findings.
No prerequisites or programming experience required. The course is designed to be accessible to all students, regardless of background or major.

"I have been wanting to learn Python for a while now and I also wanted to take a class that would expand my knowledge of data analysis/data science. This class was an ideal fit for both of these desires."
"I like the Python portion a lot. Following along to the many examples done in the videos and then doing similar ones on my own in the practice notebooks is very effective. To me, everything here is good."
"I honestly feel as though you guys did a great job with the format of this class. That means everything from the grades, organization of the assignments, videos, and written notes."
"I feel like the data science portion is done well. The reading can be pretty dense but working through examples in text and videos really helped me grasp all the conceptual material."

Fall 2022
Schedule & Location: MWF 10:40-11:30, 499 DSL
In this course, students will explore the different elements that determine the outcome of infectious disease in humans, using COVID-19 as a case study. Starting with a very basic model that includes susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, students will gradually incorporate factors that may affect the outcome of an outbreak, such as masking/quarantining, gain and loss of natural and vaccine-based immunity, and changing virulence/strains. After summarizing data already collected during the recent pandemic, students will inform the model to determine the conditions under which different outcomes may occur. Students will summarize their results graphically and present their findings.
No prerequisites or programming experience required.
The course is designed to be accessible to all students, regardless of background or major.
