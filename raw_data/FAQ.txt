Title: Travel Award Policy - FSUSciComp
url: https://www.sc.fsu.edu/faq/for-students/travel-award-policy

Travel Award Policy
Since 2024 , and until further notice, we will be contributing funds to students going to conferences to give presentations or present posters.
Any student presenting a talk or poster about their research at a national or international scientific conference is eligible to apply for up to a $1000 travel award from the department. We have a good budget for student travel awards, but it is not endless. Each student can receive one travel award in the fiscal year (July-June) as long as funds in the budget are available.
A brief description of the presentation and information regarding the conference/event should be submitted in advance to request travel funds. All money will be disbursed via Concur (travel needs to be approved before booking; flights, hotel, etc. MUST be booked through our travel agent -- no reimbursement).
I expect a student seeking the departmental award to also apply for other FSU travel awards, such as COGS travel grants. The total amount awarded cannot exceed the cost of travel. The student must be enrolled in our program and in good academic standing.

Chair, Scientific Computing
