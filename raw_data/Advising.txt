Student Advising
The Department of Scientific Computing is staffed by a full-time academic advisor, located in room

. Students are seen on a walk-in basis during normal business hours.
Students are strongly advised to seek academic advising at least once a semester, preferably before the registration cycle. Students should see individual faculty members for advice about research interests and potential Directed Individual Study (DIS) opportunities.
